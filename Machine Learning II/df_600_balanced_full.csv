Ever since I was young, I was heavily involved with competitive dance and competitive cheerleading, among with other support. Excuse me, other sports, but I've always tried to take a leadership position in those sports and avenues. Um, when I was in high school, I was actually the captain of the football team for cheerleading, and, um, that showed me a lot of good leadership traits because I had to be in charge of the team, obviously, and with that, I would control the practices, help people practice work on stunts and dances. Um, I also tend to be a leader in my friendships and in school for school. I helped through a mentoring program through my sorority, where I helped, um, tutor other girls that were younger than me in classes I had done well in. I've graduated with Dean's List, my sophomore year and president's list my senior year, so I find it very easy to be a leader, and I very much enjoy it. My ability is that helped me be a leader. Is my ability to talk with others and be able to help when there goes an issue. Um, I like to help with the issues by something that I actually learned to my classes. It's called Circle Practice or, um, circle procedure, where you ask a question and everyone gets a chance to be heard. So actually, for my class in college, I conducted one with my friend group, and it went amazing because it allows everyone a chance to talk by using a talking device. It could be a stick or whatever you would like it to be. But it gives a chance for everyone to feel heard and pose different points of an argument that maybe in a traditional setting or discussion, people wouldn't get the chance to say these things. Maybe if they're a little bit on the quiet side or the shy side, or one person or multiple people in the group discussing tend to overpower the conversation, so that can be really hard for people. But through something like that, it becomes easier for everyone to talk. Um, I also think it's really important when you're a leader to be confident in yourself, and I'm confident in my abilities to get work done. Like I said, discuss with others and when there's hard problems, get to the solution of it because that's what's most important. But obviously, it's also very important that people are satisfied. Not everyone is going to be satisfied by the decision that me if I were to be a leader in this sense, not everyone is going to be satisfied all the time with my decisions. But it's having a way to say my decision, which could upset others in the right way or discuss why I chose this avenue or this decision and that it was made very calculated and to the benefit of everyone's needs. Thank you much. Thank you very much. It was great. I hope that I am considered as a candidate for this leadership position. My name is Emma.

So I'm able to listen to people's ideas and be able to integrate them and put them with my sort of ideas as well. So we can come up with a combination of ideas to fit a whole group in order to get a task dump. A manager has to be very understanding, has to be quiet open when it comes to listening to those people around them. Um and in this case I have quite good listening skills which would benefit being in a managerial position. Um I'm confident in what I do, especially when I'm taking control of a group, confidence is needed in order to get the task done and to a higher standard pretty much. Um so I'm confident to kind of take charge of a group to lead them forward within whatever task that's taking place to get the job done well to get the result that we want. Um you have to be good, a good speaker, you have to be able to talk to everyone around you, you have to be able to engage and keep it more engaged. You have to be fair, you have to treat everyone how you expect to be treated a lot of people allow the power to get the better of them.

Everyone in the team, Everyone in the workplace should be treated the same regardless of stairs. So long as there is respect towards maja then that's fine. However ideally everyone should near enough be treated the same. Um every level it's just as important, not just the manager. Um I'm also for a managerial position. I'm incredibly, incredibly able.

So I'd be able to organize people and set them on tasks and make sure the task at hand that I need to be overseeing is sorted and finished all high standard. Um Because everything should be done to a high price standard and high quality and as a manager I'd be overseeing that people working with me were also completing things to Ohio high standard. Um A noble quality in my opinion the manager should possess is um they should be able to inspire the people that they work with. You know, inspiring with their enthusiasm, inspire them with their drive and their passion to be doing what they're doing. As a manager, you should be sure the people I work with how passionate you are towards the task at hand because the more passionate you have behind it, the better off you are not at the mall, you're going to excel in, the better it's gonna be, you know people working for, you are going to enjoy that job, more things are gonna be uh don't a significantly higher standard if people are more interested in what they do, so you gotta keep them interested, you will keep them engaged.",POSITIVE,0.9119,0.0042,0.0512,0.0327,553.0,LOW,5,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),13.46,1,0,0,"Some college, no degree",Female,8.936527,8.658687,8.248425

I'm here to explain my qualities as a leader, which makes me think that I'd be an ideal candidate to take on the manager's position. I'd like to start out by talking about the Future Team leader program that I took part in a few years ago. I was nominated to take part in this by my area team manager who thought that I had good potential to become a leader in the organization. And the Future Team Leader program was over a whole year with 52 day workshops which were Residential in different locations around the country. And I really enjoyed being on the program with about 12 other people I think. Um we did, we did a variety. We studied a variety of things like to start with what motivated because because you can't really manage others unless you understand your own your own motivation at work. So one of the very interesting things we did about that was understanding what our drivers, that stress was finding out that I really want to please people and everything has to be perfect. And I very often now find myself and displaying that and having to tell myself to stop and everything doesn't need to be perfect and not everybody needs to be happy. Even when you're, when you're a leader, there is going to be some people who aren't happy. We looked as well about motivating others. So we talked a lot about managing or change processes and what makes people engage with change, how you convince people to make a change to making things. And maybe if you want somebody somebody to do something differently, you need to do it, make it easy to make it acceptable, make it social to make them see that everybody else is doing it and I can't remember what a lot what t stood for, but hey, Yeah, so yeah, learning how to motivate others, we, we did a bit of coaching. So coaching skills which were practiced in pairs and coaching is about encouraging answers to find the answers themselves. I say encouraging others to find the answers themselves, um by just asking open questions and encouraging them to think through the problem and come up with their own solutions. We worked as a team, we did team projects, we did a play at the end of the program. So I think teamwork is important even for leaders because you're likely to have other leaders that you need to work with and while you are working, working in a team, you're not just dictating to others what they do. So I do have experience as a team leader. I was a team leader for 15 months in my old area team, I had some very difficult decisions to make. While I was in that post, I had one member of staff who came to me with a personal improvement plans I had to. but I have no clear idea of what it was. He had done wrong. So that was quite interesting working out how I could encourage him to improve when it hadn't really been made clear to me where he was failing. But we did we did yeah we we we we we found we we did sort of look at his motivation and why he was feeling unmotivated at work and found him some interesting projects to work on. Um And then I had another team member who I had to reassign which was very difficult, had some very difficult conversations um persuading him that he that he needed to go and take on a different assignment. But it's since proved to be a really good move for him. I'm currently the writing coordinator in the team's, I'm working in at the moment managing again quite a large team functionally a lot of uncertainty and the team, so listening to people listening to their worries, we've had a lot of new people joining. So I've been handling their induction program, had great feedback from that um stepping up to offer fun activities at a recent team meeting and I'm also a Morris dancer. I'm a foreman and I've been a great experience of teaching groups of people with very mixed abilities, you know we've got physical disabilities, we've got somebody with dementia, people who don't, people are dyslexic, so yeah making learning fun and and encouraging them to really enjoy themselves. So yeah I think I've got you know over the years I've developed some really good leadership abilities and I'm going to get cut off in a minute. So thanks very much for listening. Any questions.

Um I um were I was in charge of certain projects there, but I did have to delegate certain jobs to certain people, so I knew what jobs were good for some people and what jobs were good for other people, so I knew what their good points were and their bad points. I'm also good with communication where I feel that certain members can. Certain team members can come to me whether it's to do with issues at work or to do with issues at home. I think it's important to keep people that you work with happy, especially the people that work for you, happy in my current role as a property developer. I have several people that worked for me in terms of interior design, construction workers, um people uh the selling agents that rent or sell your property. And I think it's important that to have communication is one of your key um traits that you have in order to be able to have a managerial role. I noticed that when it came to needing projects in my previous roles, it was important to make sure that your team were happy with you that they were able to communicate with you. They're able to communicate what struggles they were having if they were having any. I've always felt that if your team members, people that you work with, people that you work with or work for you have to be happy for in order to have any type of happiness in the work environment and for the work to be good. Um as part of that in my personal life, I'm also a foster where I foster young Children and for that you have to have empathy, sympathy, patience all of those streets which will help in a managerial role. Especially the patients. I think if you have patients as you're one of the top five keys of being a good manager, you cannot be short tempered. It just wouldn't get you anywhere. I think people nowadays have to be able to express how they feel to their manager. It's not like it was 10, 15 years ago where you have that kind of fear of your manager where I don't think it should be now. I think it should be someone that would be able to go to will help not just for work, but even in your personal life if you are struggling and there's no one else to talk to.

It's very nice to meet you all. I'd like to find a little more out about the role that you want to fulfill this afternoon. But before we do that I'd like to tell you a little about my management skills and experience so that you can see whether I'm a good fit for the role. So I've worked with in education for almost 20 years, having previously been a PhD research scientist in cancer research as a result of these particular areas of experience, the skills that I believe that I bring to the table include things like careful communication. Science communication is extremely important and I had a lot of opportunity to communicate with people at all levels, both above with supervisors and people in charge of departments and also people in charge of grant funding when I was a research scientist and of course subordinates. So people who worked alongside me as technicians PhD students while I was a post doctoral research scientist. And lots and lots of other people who were important from my role, including admin. So I have lots of experience from that particular aspect of my work that I could bring to a management role. In addition, it was very important to communicate carefully and accurately in writing and make sure that I kept a log of the work that I did and photographic evidence of the material that I produced as well. These needed to be kept in a diarist form. So I knew the time scale that things work to once again extremely important in terms of managing people and processes. In addition I have skills in terms of computer skills which I've developed over the last 20 years as a teacher and as a manager within the teaching and education environment. So I have lots of skills in terms of word and excel, database handling presentation through power point zoom presentations. So now electronic presentations, communicating with people by email, by video conference on calls and all of the different ways that we communicate with individuals at all sorts of different levels. I also have as part of my teaching career, 10 years experience of line management. So I've managed staff individually personally and have been responsible for their day to day work, their performance management and all types of other communications that have come from senior management and have also continued through down to all of the staff from technical staff who support with the lab preparations through to other members of staff, including having in my department one of the deputy heads of the school. And so therefore that's a difficult, potentially communication in terms of me being a line manager to someone who is one of the school's senior leaders. So I have lots of experience of working with lots of different types of people in lots of different environments. I have lots of experience in terms of communication skills of different natures and in the last two years we've had lots of experience of electronic communication and that some of the subtleties of face to face communication can be lost if we're not incredibly careful with electronic communication particularly where work from home has been an issue For the last 18 months to two years and may about to become. So again so all of these different areas I believe made me a great manager. I would consider I was skilled at delegation. I also consider that I'm skilled at developing a vision and in fact I can demonstrate this best with the fact that for the last four years I've run my own business. So I'm in charge of an educational consultancy that does all to talk all sorts of types of work such as working with students who are home schooled, working with different individual students. Students who have learning difficulties from A. D. H. D. 20. D. D. And I have lots of experience of dealing with parents, older adult learners group learning. And I also run all aspects of the business. From accounting and budgeting through to marketing and advertising of the business. And even during the covid pandemic I've been able to keep afloat only doing this as my job. So I'm really hopeful that what you'll do is consider asking me some more questions or asking for some details about what I've just told you and deciding whether or not. I might be a good fit for the company.

So I always had to take care of them, make sure they're doing their homework, make sure whatever chores there, given me doing that thing. So I had this leadership ability in me since the beginning. My mother would always tell me you're the eldest and you need to take care of this, you're the leader and you need to take a look after your brothers and sisters and you need to look after what they're doing what they're not doing and keep an eye on them. So I have this leadership ability in me. It started building in, in my childhood when I, when I was in the school, my teacher would always trust, have a trust on me and I was, I don't like, I don't know how to put it out, but I was the proctor or a monitor in the class and they would let me keep an eye on students and like whenever the teacher is out of the class or something, I would check the students and stuff and it seems when I got a job, um I was always a team lead, they were very impressed with my performance and the way I was managing everything and other workers how they're performing. So they were right impressed and do you like how I'm doing. So they always giving me leaders of elite team leaders. Whenever we had a project, I was the team lead most of the time and I make sure everything do their assignments and they're part of the project on time and our projects turned out really great in the end and when I got married my husband has a lot of trust in me and he also gives me leadership status and I do whatever we have to decide in the house for our kids with decisions about our kids, whatever we need to do all the planning and everything, I decide what should we do and you just go with it. So I think I have great leadership abilities in me and I have been a leader towards my life and I did all that really in a great way and with great responsibility. So I think I am a leader, I don't know what else to say. As I've given examples from my school, from the forest school, I started being a leader and then my school examples and then the job examples I have given you guys and also now when I'm married I'm taking care of my kids. So I'm leaving here in the house too. Some people are born with this type of ability and for others it's it's just easier for them to not being a leader and like let other people do the leadership and they just do whatever other people tell them to do in my case, I want to be the person giving instructions to the other ones and like I'm very picky about if something is not done properly or something is left out, I make sure everything is done properly and every details are done the way I wanted to be, to make sure things come out great in the end. So that's why people trust me with my leadership abilities and they've always given me this responsibility of being a leader in every situation in every field of my life and I enjoy it.

And I will be talking about this in the context of the field of architecture which I am currently a student. So in terms of my experience leading a team, um I have had lots of you know, projects and work where I've been a part of a team or leading a team and within that I think it's really important. One of the most important things um is to make sure that every person within the team feels valued and that everybody's work is valued and understanding before work commences, that everybody has a different skill set. And soon I think it's absolutely vital to understand the pros and cons of every candidate and how they work and the kind of skills they can bring to the team and making sure that those are utilized in the most positive way as I believe that when people feel they're valued and feel their work is valued, they're more inclined to work harder and feel more fulfilled in the context of the team environment. In terms of my personal skills, I am a very hardworking person and I'm very organized and driven. Um I have been all my life and so work is sort of ingrained within my daily life. Um my work ethic means I want to succeed and I feel like this managerial position would be the natural next step in my career path and my ethos of work means that I have always been very driven to make the best out of every role I have and to bring the most I can to that team in terms of specific skills that I have within the field. I am proficient and cat in dubi visualization and all the traditional architecture skills which I feel like it's important to have another job even in a managerial position. I think it's important to be able to aid any member of the team with their work at any stage of the process. Um This proficiency I think is incredibly important to having respect within the team. Um I also have a lot of experience in negotiating briefs with clients and and moreover, I think understanding the client's point of view as well as the architect point of view. So where our client may value saving money. I think architects often have more of a point of view which may value the experience of the building or more of a storytelling element to it, which may be the client would not have valued as much for spending money on. But then negotiating that so that both the client and the architect is happy with the outcome. I think in terms of managing it's really important to be somebody who the team respects but also enjoys working with and I think the best work often comes out of situations where everyone in the team feels they are really happy in their day to day life in the office environment. And so I think that it's really important for the manager to understand more than just the work, but the emotional elements to each person and each person's workflow so that when the team comes together, everybody feels like they're enjoying the process as much as they can, as well as making the best work that they can. So in summary, I think that I would be successful in this managerial position due to my experience within the field, um my understanding of people and how a team works and how the importance of everybody's skills being valued and understood within the team environment in order to create work where each person feels fulfilled and the outcome is as positive as possible.

I really appreciate that I'm excited to explain to you why I feel like I would be the best candidate for this position. Um you know, having worked in HR for just about five years now, I've grown extremely passionate about so many different things and I've had some experience being able to work in leadership capacities, but I'm very excited to be able to take on more of a leadership role and really um we have a responsibility and gain more experience within that leadership capacity. Again, like I mentioned, I'm extremely passionate about HR and about leading within my role. Specifically, I've developed exceptional time management skills which is something that I believe is exceptionally essential when you get into those leadership positions. Um but more than that, one of the things I think would make the most successful in the position is the fact that I'm extremely personable. I'm someone who knows how to vary my communication approach depending on who I'm talking to. Each person that you speak with needs to be talked to in a different way, depending on the way there most receptive. And I feel like I am quite good at being able to approach them in a way that is going to meet them where they're where they're at and help engage them in the best way to make them not only excited about the work that they're doing, um but feel like they're an important member of this team because I think as a leader, that's one of the things that's extremely important, it's motivating your team, showing them that you are, you know, as much as you might be their leader, you are also part of that team and you're there to encourage and support them. So that's something I I feel that I'm very good at and I believe I bring to this team and beyond that. I think another skill of mine is that relationship building peace, regardless of who the person is, I feel like I'm able to connect with them. Um but beyond all of those things, I think one of the things that is really important when we're looking at leadership positions is someone who has the strength and ability to, you know, say that's a great idea, but also the ability to say, you know, this isn't the right thing right now or we need to move in a different approach in a different way, because although, again, like I am very personable, there's a piece to which as a leader, you may have to get into some uncomfortable situations and I'm more than happy to have those conversations. I love providing feedback to people. I love getting feedback myself and having those constructive conversations to be able to support us both in being um that our team members and that our leader going forward um beyond that, I love to think I am out of the box thinker, I am all about the big picture, which as a leader, I think is extremely important when you're looking at those who are going to be underneath you as well. I think one of the things when it comes to my leadership style, um I am more of a laid back leader. I do really believe that if you give your subordinates or team members the trust and encouragement and the ability that you know they can do that work, that is what gets them so engaged and so excited about the work that they're doing of course, you know, checking in and you know, some people will need more than others, which again happy and I understand as well knowing, you know, meeting people and that as well, I think it's really important in that to make sure that we're doing that kind of support for our employees um as well, when it comes to all these different things, I find one of my strengths is communication, like I've said verbal and written and I understand that there's going to be times when you have to have conversations that are unpleasant and I am quite good at those. I feel that that's one of my strengths as well um when it comes to weaknesses, I do, you know, as much, most of us say perfectionism of course, which you know, as as cliche as that, maybe it is true, I think that there's a sense to which I try to make sure everything that I do is absolutely perfect, but I have to understand that it's not going to be. So that beings that I am fairly aware of my own strengths and weaknesses and I'd like to bring those out within my team members. Um, I think as a leader, the most important thing you can do is respect and build up your subordinates and those people that are interviews because although you have work to do yourself the main task, that mean everything, the main part of being a leader is building up those underneath you. Um one of the things I also am very big on is being available. I think it's very important as the leader as a manager, no matter what field you're in, whether you're working in an office or at home, you make yourself available to your team members and two people so they know they can reach out to you with questions and making sure that, you know, you also have the ability to say, hey, you know what, I made a mistake or you know, I'm a spoke here and I said something in an incorrect way, being able to own up to that and just being um someone who is willing to also listen to their two members and say that's a great idea. Um, I think that is one of the things that makes a leader really great just to wrap all of this up. I believe I'm the best candidate for this position for a lot of different reasons, but not only my experience and my passion, but my desire to really make a difference is what makes me the best person for this position. So thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me today. I hope that, um, I tried to do with lots of information that you understand why I would be the best candidate for this position.

Mm I think that I would be the perfect candidate for the management position um for a number of reasons. And firstly I am a team player. I believe that everyone has any special set of skills and it manages job to understand what everyone's skills are, their strengths and weaknesses and to use those so that the team can perform to its best ability and railing show what's possible and and very decisive I when a decision needs to be made, I'm good at looking at all the facts and seeing what I'm presented with, asking the questions that need to be asked to gain additional information if required and then using that information to make the best decision at the time, it's not always the correct decision. You get more information in hindsight um and the experience, but I feel like I have enough experience to be able to make those difficult decisions. I'm also a great listener and this is really important when it comes to managing a team because it's the only way you can create a environment and relationships within your team that really people trust and feel that there the opinions are valued and that they we're in a team that care work better when I think that that team cares about them. Additionally, I worked in this team and in this area from the bottom up, I have a great understanding the daily challenges that my team would come across and so I'll be able to support the best because I've had those experiences and those experiences with a good manager and I've had those experiences with a bad manager and it really is good management which makes you confident with those issues come up so that you can do your best and I know that your manager is listening to you and they understand where you're coming from and there's nothing worse than having a manager that's never done your job, but things were no better than you when you have all the experience in the world. So I think that's another thing as well, it's very trusting which I think is vital in as manager, if you don't trust your team, you will micromanage them, they will be unhappy and just it won't be a nice environment, you can't get the best out of people if you're not trusting them to do their job and it's not that ability that I have.

I come across as calm and encouraging and cooperative and I'm approachable. Um, therefore that makes for a better relationship. If someone can trust you and you trust them, uh, you're more willing to share ideas and people don't take, uh, maybe your criticisms of them not criticisms, but like when you critique their performance, they don't take it as negatively because you are saying it kindly, but also constructively. Uh, you know, the big thing is you, you want the person to be able to grow from the experience. And also, I think one of the really good points that I have is I encourage people to do their best. I show them how something is done. I show them how I want it done. I show them the correct way and then I let them take over and start showing me, um, how they're doing it. And uh, it's at that point where I would either say, hey, that's great, you know, give them some pointers or you have to do it this way or that way and that sharing that experience together also sort of builds camaraderie and um, the other people feel like they're on a team with you and it isn't this crazy setup where you're here and they're down here, that they realize that, You know, we're all in this together type thing. I think that really is a big thing because I know throughout my 30 year career I've encountered some bosses or supervisors that were very bright and caught on really fast but they didn't have the people skills there is that you need to try to encourage somebody or if they're having a bad day you have to sort of pick them up and inspire them or, let's face it. Sometimes sometimes people just don't get a certain concept and you have to be able to rephrase it and work to give that the person that you're trying to mentor a chance to catch on to what's going on. So I think that's another aspect of my personality. I'm patient and tolerant. I'm willing to two think outside the box to explain something so that I can encourage somebody else to to learn how to do it the proper way. And with all of these skills that I have also, you know, my accounting education, my C. P. A. License, all this speaks to my um willingness and dedication uh to to to see a task done and um I want to instill that same quality to all those who are on my team or that I'm supervising. I think that's a you know that's a great way to get an employee who's dedicated as you lead by example. Um And also I would try to be somewhat flexible um Because I think that also helps build uh people makes people more of a people pleaser to help you out when you need it. If you're flexible with them, you know, like if for instance, they have to leave a client early to go see their child perform and, you know, an elementary school play or whatever, I would do that because they would remember that for the next time that I need help. And again, it just reinforces that we're a team. We share common goals and uh, we're just doing it to to make our team stronger. So with that said, I hope I get the job and thank you for giving me this opportunity.

I believe I'm perfect for a manager role because of my current skills and abilities to start off. I'm currently working as assistant project manager. This role has allowed me to develop and refine my manager to real skills. I believe I have the ability to show strong communication skills, training skills and teamwork skills in the workplace. My current role as an assistant project manager and system of delegating, coed coordinating projects so they can be finished within a certain time scales. Currently my task include communicating and negotiating the key stakeholders to make sure deadlines the map. I'm also a point of contact during projects for outside sources of key people to contact if companies doing. I'm the point of contact and I also have to get assaulted straight away. I'm also also capable of using project management tools um to hit targets and take off me milestones. The current project management tool and familiar with it's called Asana which is used uses gun chance in order to create timeline with priorities and time scales. This can be used for key stakeholders to refer back to for people just know where the on track on the project and it's just an important skill. I'm also able to use Excel and make spreadsheets to make sure everything is being done on time. People underestimate the use of spreadsheets and how it can keep track of milestones and just it could have important information there at the click of a bottom other management skills I have included managing staff during projects as well as training them. So they also competitive skills that they will need in future projects where I may not be there. Yeah, it also shows how capable I am is working in successful team. My main managerial strength is delegated for motivating people. This is especially when pressures may be high, when things may be tough and where deadlines may need to be met quickly um as an assistant manager, I believe it's important to make sure everyone's morale stays high, especially in fast paced environment and when there's a lot of targets and pressure on the staff, I also believe that managing is being a good listener as well as being a good leader. Therefore I make sure all my staff and stakeholders know they can come to me if they need help and I can offer a solution to the problem they may be facing, which leads me to my next strength which is problem solving as a manager and able to show initiative, especially in situations where pressure may be high and where a problem maker and it is solving quickly. Sometimes it's just putting something that until the problem can get solved. So the temporary fix. But I do believe this is important as a manager. I also believe I am able to set KPs high KPs for myself and fast paced environment. We're really striving to do better and be better. Therefore I do think this is amazing skill for a manager overall, I have sought about my current job but I do feel like it reflects on my management skills very well, um, over skills I'd like to say, is just eight being able to communicate well with all people in the team, so you've got to learn how to talk to stuff that may be lower than your reasonably and people higher than you. And I just of the things that I'm competent at, such as Word Microsoft office, which is really important. So I do think that's important to being a manager.

I hold a national Diploma in building Technology and Advanced diploma in Q. S. And A B and C. Are news in quantity surveying, but nonetheless I do believe that I'm a good leader, not because of my career because I have worked with a number of people for example, I have done tutoring in my pastors, especially in the university. So I do believe that I'm a good leader because I am a strong believer of people's unique abilities. For example, I have dealt with learners who had unique abilities which are different from each other, but that did not discourage me, especially when I was doing cuter and with them. I have given them my definite attention each and every student because I do believe that everyone has a unique ability in themselves. And another thing that makes me a good leader. It is because I am very slow to anger. Yes, I do. I do know that this is uh unbelievable, but I am very slow to anger and very patient, very patient with people. And this also contributes. And another thing I'd like to outline is my compassion. You know what, when I'm dealing with people, I'm very compassionate before I want to punish you or before I want to cut you off, I do make sure that I also offer compassion before all of that. Yes, you might upset me, but before that I do need a reason and that reason might allow me to have compassion towards you. You know, so it is, it also contributes in my good um leadership skills and another one is teamwork, Oh my God, I'm a fan of teamwork because I believe that um teamwork makes the dream work, you know? So I'm a fan, I'm a firm believer of teamwork and in any case or any given opportunity, if I am working with the team, I am absolutely delighted, okay. And another thing is I'm a good listener, you know? So my listening skills are at the top priority, so I am a very good listener and I have, as I have mentioned before, I have worked with learners and I have done english tutoring before, so yes, I do believe that I'm a good listener um and I have good combustion for people, so yes, uh that also counts and my good uh and my good uh leadership qualities and the last one now is my resilience alright, I'm one person who sets down goals who believes in writing down manifestation and so forth. So when I plan to achieve something, I do make sure that I set my goals according to short term goals, media term goals and long term goals. For example, if I were to achieve something within six months, then I'll definitely divide that six months into two months, two months, two months, you know, trying to achieve the complete goal. So for me um achieving my goals is also proof of my resilience, I remember in university when I was going to do my advanced diploma, when I went to university that year, I did not have funding or even registration fee, but I did go to university nonetheless, because I had this resilience that you know what, even if I do not have this funding, but when I do get university maybe I might get help from people at the university. And to my surprise I did get the help and I did manage to to complete my advanced diploma without funding, you know, So I did apply for funding at the end of that year because I had great results. So that is a proof of resilience. Anything that I set my mind in doing, I obviously achieve it. So resilience is part of my good leadership skills, which means that in every opportunity that I'm given to finish a task or to prove myself, I am quite resilient. I do not quit, I make sure that I get the work done. So um I do believe that this is a very good leadership skill for for leaders, you know, because if you want to be a leader, your team has to see uh in you that you know what, we cannot be taking task and leaving them halfway. You know, you have to be able to prove to them, you have to be able to model to them that you are a resident person, come rain or come sunshine, you'll always be there to finish whatever you are given to do, you know?

My name is Eden and did I will tell you why I am the best person for this position. So since I was a little kid, I was very passionate about helping others and reading others for me, there's a difference between leadership and management. If I get accepted for this position, I would be a leader, not the manager. And let me explain why leaders of someone who inspire employees. They help employees employees, they lead by example and managers are just there to do the job, right? So they're there to see what is right, what is wrong. But for me personally, I want to be a leader. I want to inspire through my ways and also hopefully help others. So I will just explain what qualities I have as a leader. So first of all, the most important thing that I have is integrity, right? So I don't just do things because it should be done. I basically apply my conscious so I am someone that do what is right instead of just doing something because it should be done. So another thing also we said I believe in encouraging innovativeness, right? So we do not want to do the same boring routine over and over. Rather we want to encourage an innovative environment by making everyone feels safe and also okay to be outspoken and that is the best way for business to grow in my opinion. Um I'm honest, So I'm very, very honest. My parents know me also as someone that's very honest, sometimes a bit too honest, but honestly is the best because in the workplace you have to be um honest with your management, otherwise you are putting them in a tough spot. If you are not honest, then they have to think about. Should I encourage you? Should I support you because you are a good person, but you're not honest. So we always honest. Another thing is also, I'm an active listener, so I'm not just the boss, I am also your friend, but important, you work friends. So there's a level of respect. So I am a listener. I listen to all my employees problems because happy employees means a happy workplace, they're going to be more trustworthy and they're also going to be more retain Herbal. So it's very important that you listen to what your employees and your customers are telling you. So basically what all your stakeholders are telling you because they are speaking for a reason. Another quality that I have is I have self confidence, I have confidence in my work. I might not be the best person with qualifications, but I will definitely make you believe that I am the best for the job because that's just who I am as a person. I'm very confident, I'm very honest. I have a vision in mind for both me and my company. Another quality that I would say I have is communication skills. I have never been one to just hold back, I communicate very well, so that means that whenever there is an issue, I will ensure that you know of it but also in a well manner. So I will not just spill my mouth, I'll know my time in my place but I will communicate the problem effectively Delegation OK. So I have never been one to fear delicate in my work because sometimes as a manager it is really difficult to complete 10 task at one time, but maybe you have employees that can complete the task in time. So that is your time to also trust your employees and let them shine also in their own way. So that is who I am as a boss. I delicate work we needed and I also have to ensure that it's a proper person that I'm giving the task to. Mhm. I also possess very good decision making skills so I know what to do or I will apply variant various methods when it comes to decision making. Such as imagining that I'm talking to management, how would I approach that or these different approaches to management? Then the east to your customers, in the east of your employees. So I bear all of that in mind. So for me I wish to be a leader and these skills that I possess is very good.

Um So in brief for the last two years I have been in land manager responsibility which means it's part of my role. I have people reporting to me. Um There's so many elements this role. Absolutely doll. So you have the basic of building report with people and watching them grow and develop your helping the death stare running of your organization. So at the moment I work in social housing and I support all the colleague. So I'm classed as a team manager and so I do the same job as then but also support them. So from a skills and capabilities point of view as well as um any performance management, any other sort of development. I'm um supporting them with that. It may be that you have a colleague that is really good at the job that they do and you just ensure that they are keeping on top of that. You also have colleagues that want to learn and grow and develop and then his colleagues that are underperforming and at times you have to have different conversations with those. We've also got general people management side of things. So that could be anything from um sick days and you'll leave and managing everything in that. So I think people see managers and bosses as bad guys. Um I've definitely had experience of those old school management managers and bosses which is why I prefer the leadership role and the leadership would and um I will lead the whole flock sounds cheesy but I will ensure that everybody is yeah feels included and everybody feels part of the team and I have done some additional line and that's why I've got a certificate in. Mhm and understanding of leadership. It covered everything from recruitment which I have done to people management to um those 1 to 1 conversations and then also people are leaving and there's more difficult conversations so from people leaving leaving having to end contract. I've also worked on grievances and disciplinary um So I've got a little bit of everything but I also know what I need from leaders and I think helping people understand they can talk to their leader about what they need. Um Being open to try different things that a colleague may need and then working and having that conversation which I think in essence as long as you're having really really good quality conversations you're doing the best for your people. Um And I think it's really important to lead by example. So I do have those good chords conversations. I will try things, I will monitor things if it doesn't work for me if it doesn't work for my leader and we'll talk about those and I want to ones and then I'll also share those with the once, once I have with my team just to say that this is what I'm working on, this is what's worked for me, This is what hasn't worked for me because I think that makes everything more human and honesty is very, very key and in everything we do, but especially as a leader, I think it makes you more genuine, more authentic and helps colleagues see that that's the right thing to do for the right reasons I think as well. Um, when I'm in a role and when I'm looking for a role, I look at the values of an organization and ensure their in line with my arm. And when I do any recruiting to recruit for values and I think tasks and skilled, they can be taught. Whereas if you've not got the right values, um, you're never going to be working in line with the organization and then you kind of set yourself up to fail. So I really think look at an organization's values and vision and ethos is really, really key.

I've got a lot of experience behind me in different fields which rely on different forms of communication and also communicating with different people. I've worked with the elderly with the young. I do have a lot of empathy which I think Alina does need to have and I have worked with various people, some people very vulnerable, which has been meant that I've had to become more aware of people's emotions and show empathy. I naturally quite a big problem solver is something that I enjoy doing and I like finding different ways to solve problems. And so therefore I think as well that is another skill that leader needs to have. Um naturally I am a very creative person. I learned creatively and I enjoy doing creative things in my spare time. I like to do photography. And again, I think a great leader would have that kind of creativity side to them. So that's something that I'd love to put forward. I think over the years of working within the company, I have learned how to delegate effectively and so everybody has their strengths and it's about finding people who fit different tasks more appropriately than others. Everybody has something that they're good at and you know, finding the right balance of things is important to be able to delegate effectively. And definitely over the years become more confident in my decision making. There was a time when I was filled with self doubt and now I do feel that I've built them resistance and reliance on myself to be able to make decisions, difficult decisions a lot of time as well. Um but I do understand that a leader needs to be able to be flexible and understand that not everything is gonna work out for everybody at one time and so being flexible and portraying that to your staff and people that you are managing is so important to make them feel supported by you as a manager. I am an active listener, I wouldn't say that comes naturally and it is something that I have had to definitely work on, but I do feel the power of listening and making people felt as though they are listened to. That is such an important factor as a leadership role. My confidence has increased over the last few years in my ability to do things myself. Again, it's not something that comes naturally to me at times. I've been known to completely fall apart because of self doubt, but I am learning to become more confident in myself and my abilities, I am very self aware, I think it's important to reflect on our ability to do things. You know, nobody is good at everything. I am very self critical, but very self aware of what it is I'm good at and what it is. I'd like to work on, but I think one of the more important factors to me, myself as a leader would be the ability to adapt, so your adaptability to different situations and working with different people, again, finding people's strengths and helping them to work on their strengths and their weaknesses to be the best version of themselves.",POSITIVE,0.706,0.0162,0.2661,0.0117,563.0,MED,8,98.0,1.0,Using only (2),8.360001,1,0,0,"Bachelor's degree (e.g. BA, BS)",Female,7.188742,6.948873,6.496133

Um I think that people do respond to me very well and that I've got good leadership qualities. I'm a very fair person and I'm a very calm person. So I think that those two put together we're a very good start. Um Examples of my leadership qualities shine through in my running club, so I'm a member of a running club and I've done the training so that I'm able to become a leader, which means that on our weekly meetings on Wednesday, I one of the leaders who take the group for a run. Um And also I've been involved in beginners Sessions which usually last eight weeks in the summer. All my running friends have commented that I make a really good leader because I encourage people through positivity. I never get bored and try and hurry people along that are struggling at the back. I always make time for those people to try and help them become a better runner. And as I say, my running friends often comment that I seem to excel in this role. Um I enjoy it too. I like helping people. So I guess being a manager, it's all about helping people are your staff to achieve good results. I'm very reliable anyway naturally and I always try to do my best for my boss or my superiors. I don't like to be the person that lets anybody down so I can definitely be relied on to do whatever work is necessary as well as to keep my staff happy, but also make sure that they're putting the best in that they can. I do find in the running club, my positivity does help people. They do thank me at the end of the session and one girl in particular really was a complete beginner, but she really wanted to do well and wanted to enter a park room. She knew she wouldn't be able to do very well in the beginning, get I get a good time. Um But park run for a beginner, it doesn't matter if you run a walk as long as you finish it. So I said that I'd run it with her, so we arrange that I did run it with her, although I walked quite a lot of the time because she was taken very slow steps. Um I encouraged her all the way around, especially when she was about to give up completely. I explained that it doesn't matter if you slow in the beginning, as long as you get round, i. E. You do a good job. Um so we got round in about 40 minutes, which wasn't bad for a complete beginner. Normally apart run for me takes about 28 minutes. I didn't feel annoyed having to slow down for her. She said that I was very patient with her too and she she felt really good afterwards and I actually felt really good afterwards too, really good for helping somebody to achieve something.

I think one of the challenges with the role as well is also about getting the best out of your people, so that could be getting the best out of your subordinates, getting the best out of your peers, getting the best out of your senior management as well. But actually collaborating with other people is incredibly important. So I think that's very much my leadership style in that I bring people together, I develop relationships with people and that means that you get the best out of these people and it actually makes your job a lot easier in the long run. So actually having a really good awareness of other people's skills and experiences means that as a leader, I'm able to to delegate effectively to people who perhaps have got relevant skills and experience. But at the same time, I'm also looking to develop my people as well. So if I've got a project coming up which perhaps requires um somebody to to do some research or to do some initial work, and I feel I've got a member of my team who would be who would gain valuable experience from doing that, then it might be something that I would look in terms of a training and development opportunity for them to get involved in. Um And I think one of the key things as well obviously with your people is if you're involved in recruitment of your team, um actually recruiting the best people in the first place, and often that means that you actually recruit people who have got skills that you don't have. Um And I think that's really important. I don't personally need to have all the skills and all the experience. What I need to be able to do is to bring people together to be able to effectively manage the people, get the best out of them, but also to be able to keep the projects and the activities that we've got going on track. And I think over the years I've worked in a number of different industries and the key, the kind of common thread that runs through all of the different roles I've had is it's working closely with other people. So I feel that over the years I've really developed a keen sense of how to get the best out of people, how to read people how to deal with them. Um an empathetic way um but also not in a too soft way either, I think some people do need to be pushed, they do need to be pushed to encourage them to do a little bit more than they perhaps think they can. So I think one of the key things I do is also look at people and try and identify untapped potential in them, which I think is it's probably quite challenging because some people do take a little bit of kind of persuasion that they can actually manage more than they're doing. Um but in terms of my leadership abilities and experience, I do have a wealth of experience. Um but the main focus of my experience is on working with other people. So collaborating, getting the best out of people, developing people, allowing them to use their skills and experience to the best of their ability. And that actually means that my job as a leader is much easier. It's much less stressful because I know I'm surrounded by an experienced team of people who have got relevant skills and experience in order to the jobs that are employed to do, and that means that my role can be much more focused on the higher level stuff, as well as maintaining those relationships",POSITIVE,0.4563,0.026,0.2834,0.2343,693.0,LOW,5,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),9.91,1,0,0,"Master's degree (e.g. MA, MS, MEd)",Female,9.793566,9.514882,9.106324

Um so I've been in my current position for now for four years prior to that, I worked for previous organization for 14 years in the same area of work, I've handled many projects and I have seen those projects from start to begin from start to end. Um I've been able to do their own budget and on time, on a few occasions actually ahead of time Um I also have the experience of managing teams of various sizes. I currently manage a team of 10 individuals of various skills and various specialists special ISMs. Um and I make sure I appraise every single one of those individuals. I'm keep in contact with them regularly. Are you sure that their work is done to a satisfactory standard? So there's effective monitoring and oversight of those works and those projects that my team undertake. Um in terms of my managerial skills, I have dealt with projects that are quite um in the media Um in the public arena, such as one particular project that I've been leading on for the past five years, which is an income generating project for the organization. And from the moment I have arrived up to date, I have been able to generate over Â£2 million pounds into the organization which has benefited the residents of the area and facilitated more efficient and streamlining and effective delivery of services. Um I also um used to doing public speaking, I have done a number of public speaking engagements on behalf of the organization to promote a number of projects that we are I am leading on um I've also have experience of budget monitoring, so with the team that I have with the projects that I look after, it's my responsibility to ensure that the budgets are handled effectively and and I've been very successful in this and at times and I have been called upon to actually identify cost saving um areas and I've been able to do that without having to lose any staff. Um Additionally I have being given the opportunity to actually mentor other members of the team and to up skill them to ensure that the standard of their work and their level of special is um is the best it can be and that has involved actually doing some training myself as I am fully competent and an accredited trainer and so I've been able to actually help the organization save money in this area in upscaling members of the of the team of this organization overall. Um So what that has helped with is succession planning to ensure that as members of the team are promoted or move on to other things.

Um This would come with like leadership skills and also communication skills to enable you to have that authority and respect as a manager, you have quite a lot of responsibility, so I think it would be important to be able to communicate with people and make sure that you're putting out what you want to get back um With these communication skills become approachability and people coming up to you and actually asking for support and asking for help. Um I also think you need to belong with approachability and communication skills, you need to have good time management so that you can work on a quick schedule, you probably will have quite a lot of work to do. Um And so time management skills is something that would be really beneficial um Because because also if you're not you don't have good time management skills, you're then presenting to the team, you're managing that you don't have Qatar management skills so they don't need to either which could then cause people to come in late for work. Um I also think being presentable communication skills and organized, I think that all really great attributes a manager can have. Um But above all I think you just need to be able to speak to people have a good present so that people listen to you and be kind and nice and supportive to your to your team because if you want you aren't giving off that personality trait then people won't really want to respond to you and they'll do it just for work and they won't have any passion in what they're doing. Um so I think it's really important to get to know your staff and understand your team and know who you're working with because if you don't then they won't really want to give you any time a day besides their job anyway, so people will just be coming into a turn and then going home, which, although it's it's good and it's what you need, it's not, it's not going to keep your staff, it's going to make people come and go and so that's what I think would be good as a manager. Um I think in terms of abilities and skills besides being approachable and having a communication skills, you need to be quite quick and like I said, not work stress under pressure but be able to not only work under pressure, but work a good time under pressure. So you're probably going to be having people come to you day in day out with new things and get used to that, it probably won't be a repetitive job and if it is, it'll be repetitive in terms of, there's so much going on um as a manager, you're kind of in control of a lot of people in control of the team and what everyone in that team gets up too. So you have, people are relying on you and you have to take on that responsibility. So you kind of need to be responsible. You need to have presence, you need to be able to speak to people and make it clear what you need from them because a lot of times managers do just leave you in the dark and you're left to fend on your own when really all they need to do is explain clearly what you're, what you're expected to do and then you can move on um and get on with it. But yeah that skills and abilities, time management and thinking fast and solving problems um under pressure and stress I think that I think would be really good because you're bound to be put in those situations day in day out and it's very likely that you'll end up needing skills like that along with approachability and along with communication, all of them kind of come into one big bubble and those things that you we'll use every single day in a management position kind of depends on which management role you're going for. But realistically these are attributes and personality traits in your character that you'll use in most leadership and management roles because in most jobs in almost every job you will need to be able to speak to people and discuss things um and understand what point you're putting across and what point someone else's putting across to.

I wanted to talk a little bit about why I think I'm the best candidate for the position and I think a lot of the reasons I'm going to talk about are related to my excellent leadership abilities. One example that comes to mind is recently within admissions. We were given a task to increase the amount of students who enrolled in our institution from all over the country. We had never had a nationwide um initiative before and we didn't really know how to proceed with it, even the management level, even the highest people in the organization. We're wanting to try things out and see if we could increase our admissions numbers. And one of the things that I worked on immediately was I developed a really comprehensive territory management plan all on my own, with very little guidance from others and I implemented that plan among members of our team and staff. And with the plan that I developed, we were able to increase an admission from east coast students by 30%, which was a huge increase, way bigger than we had even expected to see. And I contribute a lot of that success to both my implementation of the territory management plan. But then also sitting with my colleagues and really explaining to them what the process was going to be um and making sure that they could implement it as well.

Thank you for meeting with me today. I would like to share with you why? I believe that I'm the best candidate for this managing position, and I think that I have developed some key leadership abilities and skills that make me the most ideal candidate. I believe that in my experience of nearly 10 years working in different school settings, whether that be primary schools, secondary schools or academies and different trusts have given me the best start and obviously the best start in my career to be able to build on those leadership qualities and work with a really great team. Um, the leadership qualities that I believe that I possess at the moment and things that I have been working on and continue to build on every single day as I think they are the most important our accountability, communication, decision making, transparency and passion, most importantly, passion. I feel like if you're not completely in love with what you do for your job and the work that you do, if you're not completely all in, then you're just that that vibe isn't going to come across to your team, and you're gonna look a little bit halfhearted. So I do believe that one of the key, um, attributes that a leader should have is to be fully passionate about the work that they do so that this transpires down to the rest of their team and their workforce. Um, obviously being accountable, every everyone makes mistakes. You know, Great Leader is the right person that will put their hands up and say, Yeah, I've made a mistake, but this is how we're going to learn and grow from it. I think that when people start to blame others for mistakes that might not be their own, or maybe something they've done. It doesn't show that person in a good light. And I feel like leaders need to have they have that accountability and be that go to person. So I think that accountability is another skill that I have personally been working on, and I'm really proud to say that in the mistakes I've made, I've definitely learned and grown from them and built on in my career. Um, in terms of decision making, obviously leaders are asked to make difficult decisions nearly on a daily basis. You know, leaders have to be that person to make a tough call. And in everyday life you have to have to be that person that's gonna be the one to act. You have to show that you are able to lead your team and your workforce and be that person that's gonna be standing at the front and making that difficult decision. And also it shows that your person that is, trust where they go to as well. And I feel like I do possess those qualities and I am decisive. And I explained to others and communicate it well, well to them, so that they would understand how I've come to that decision and also in situations where it is a difficult decision. And it might not be what they want to hear, just having that empathy and explaining to them. This is how I've come to that decision, and I believe this is how we're going to move forwards. How do you feel about that? Let's talk about it and discuss So I do feel like having that accountability in that decision making is the most ideal attributes for a leadership for a leader to have coming back to your communication. Obviously working in a busy office environment. It's easy to have communication slip by the wayside, and I think that as a leader in um, environment like that, it's really important that your communication feeding down and drip feeding through down to your team is really, really secure. And you're constantly talking and discussing with those team members every day so that nothing gets missed. Um, there's so many, obviously, so many different forms of communication. Now there's no reason as to why things have to be missed. Um, so I think that obviously In myself, in the last 10 years, where I've worked in those environments and have worked in schools, I think that my communication skills have definitely advanced beyond those of many others. And I want to share those skills with other people so that they can be better to, um and obviously just be a great leader to them. Um, and last but not least, obviously your passion being transparent with other people. I think if you're honest with others, then you just know exactly where you stand. You're approachable to them. People want to be working in a positive working environment, and I think that happy working environment just is the most important thing for a team. So having that honest go to trustworthy person is the best thing ever that leader can have and obviously sharing that passion with others.

Firstly, I realized that being a principal of such a school comes with a great amount of responsibility. Being a leader in a school such as Silver Ox, which is situated in a township means that I need to be in the forefront of the daily running of the school. Not only will I need to do the managing of the, of the school behind closed doors, but I will need to be very active and ensuring that learners learn the best way that they can and the teachers are enabled to teach themselves. I understand that this position requires a certain amount of experience and that is why I feel that my amount of experience will be sufficient to push me and help me in being the best principle for this school. Firstly, before coming here, I was already a principal in Lancia Vale secondary school, which is not too far from here. Before then I taught in a primary school in nature arena where I was promoted to being an H O D after three years of teaching in the school because they saw how valuable I am and how I was always in the forefront of making sure that whenever there are conflicts I'm there to help out and that the best interests of learners are always in encouraging me to do the best I can for the learners, being a manager of a school does not necessarily mean that are only two always baby be in the office and that sort I understand that being a manager of a school means that I will need to make sure that teachers work collaboratively to make sure that all learners, regardless of the teacher that is teaching them will receive the best education. I understand that when teachers work together, they will be able to bounce off ideas one another and wherever one teacher lacks the other one will help and then cover me being a principal means that I will be fostering all these collaborative freaking and in effect it will help the learners. Again, being a manager of the school will also mean that I am active in making sure that learners up at school on time, meaning that if I need to take one hour or 30 minutes in the morning to patrol the streets of El Dorado Park, I will do so uh walking around or driving around to push learners to go into school. Another reason that I feel that I am the best um candidate for this position is the fact that I am very hard on myself, meaning that whenever the learners are not doing well or whenever the teachers themselves are not doing well, I will feel that it reflects directly on me, meaning that I will have it conscious that I will need to account to this, then also means that I will constantly strive to push those who are working with me to make sure that all the learners and all the teachers are doing what they have pledged to do, which is to learn and teach learners again, I feel that I am the best candidate for this job because I have a way with people, I am very charismatic, so teachers and learners are like, will be drawn to me and even when I bounce off ideas, I will try to do so without forcing my position down in one's throat, I will make both the learners and the teachers to feel that we are all one, there's no hierarchy of power or anything of that sort, you are all striving for one thing and so the power is quite secular instead of being in a hierarchy. Another reason that I felt that I'm the best candidate of this position is that um I'm very brilliant and I've had years and years of teaching, so I will not be talking down on teachers without understanding their daily struggles in the classroom, I'll be talking from experience and even when they do have struggles, I will easily be able to help them out to meet the outcomes of the curriculum. Once again, thank you so much for giving me this opportunity to sell myself to you. I hope to hear from you soon.

One of the main areas that it should be part of the Vienna manager is having good communication skills that only helps you with the people that are within your team, but also leadership above you to make sure everyone knows what you want from them, make sure everyone knows what is expected from you. And also just to make sure that you're clear with any guidance that you're givin any task that you're setting anything really just communication is really key to having a clear relationship with colleagues. Um integrity is probably another good quality to have um accountability so that that others know that you it's okay to make mistakes, try not to um but to take account of your actions whether being good or bad. Um and I think it's also good for adam as a manager to show that they can do that too. Um Having empathy with staff, not every day is an easy work day. There's also going to be problems that they have in their home lives, work lives and having to do with difficult tasks sometimes depending on what the job is and different things can impact their workloads. So having empathy and understanding with the communication um where they're coming from and um another part of being a manager would probably be resilience. Um Not every day is easy. Um not heavy employees easy either and you've got to be resilient to demands and your workload within your remit and also the people that you're leading to. Um It also it's also important to being part of a good leader um would be having a vision of the company and believing in it, believing in the job that you're doing is making a difference to the company. Um Other business that you're in um and by doing so it makes others have a bit more complex, a bit more and enthusiasm with their job. That is not just a job that you're doing something more than that said that when they come to work, they do feel a bit more empowered to do the best and being a manager, you have a lot of influence on those around you, not just the ones that your co workers that are working within your team below you. Um it's all the managers that are around you, if they can see that you're doing a really good job, they're gonna want advice from you. Um they're good at, their team, might want to go and work with you and you might be poached for another team and being part of of being being a good manager would be part of being positive, having a positive outlook, doing things negatively never helps the business or a team. Um and being positive is probably a key thing, probably the most thing that I would say is being a good manager, um certain aspects of being a manager do you have to delegate and it is important to delegate just so that your workload doesn't get too much, but also so that you understand of everyone's job role, if you have all your workloads, you cannot do your managerial jobs as well. Um But it's also important as part of being part of a team is to understand what everyone's job is within that. Um And not just to delegate just the really boring tasks or the task that you want to avoid, because that's not part of being a good manager, a good manager will know every single job and have have done every single job and be able to give their input and their experience into that and and then probably the biggest one would be having confidence in yourself as being a manager, being able to lead others and having confidence in your staff, empowering them with one to ones and supervision is to make sure that they they're happy within their roles um that they they're enjoying their job, they're in, they've got confidence in the work that they're producing, the confidence in hitting any targets that are set for them.

Um bye listening to them and asking reflective, asking questions that help them to reflect on their own situation, helping them to explore a brainstorm the options that they have for their own skill development and their own performance um and then helping them to create action plans which will move them towards a target or a goal. So that's one of the main skills I use. Um communication is another really important skill in leadership, I think it's particularly important to use positive communication whenever possible, so that doesn't mean that we ignore negatives and we think that problems that exist, but that means that I always try to be constructive in my communication and not to be negative or pessimistic in communicating. I think it's highly important for leaders to represent constructive and thoughts and communication. Um I think a goal setting is another really important thing for leadership, so um being able to establish a short and long term objectives on an individual level for staff members and their performance and also combining that with planning skills for larger project and team based objectives um or the leadership skills that help that I use I think is being good with people being able to talk to a wide range of people and and be able to develop a rapport with someone, to be able to see them as a whole person and understand the kind of complexity of a person and get to know them a little bit so that you can understand their strengths, their weaknesses, their motivation, what drives them. Um and this can be really useful in helping you to get the best out of people and other skills are useful I guess. Um I think delegation is important being able to so understanding uh what resources you have around you in your team and being able to delegate appropriate work too, and the right people that's important of course, yeah. Mhm. I think being decisive is important, so quickly being able to make and educated and high quality decisions, it's really important. So that means in order to be able to do that you need to be prepared for situations that you find yourself in. Um I think effective decisiveness means that you can you clearly understand the options that are available and the consequences of a decision and that means having in depth knowledge about your industry and the position that your team is currently in and unless all of these things are skills that you develop over time, I think and",NEUTRAL,0.4769,0.0018,0.5212,0.0002,484.0,LOW,4,97.0,1.0,Using only (2),8.0,1,0,0,"Master's degree (e.g. MA, MS, MEd)",Female,7.155255,6.911431,6.482355

So in the past I have had a few managerial positions, each of them have enjoyed a lot. The most recent one, I was in charge of about four separate people on a project where we had to develop computer system, a billing system for quite a large utilities company. The team, I had to select from members within the organization, so there was a limited pool of resource uh but I think I was able to spot a team that would fit together well and that would have the right skills and personality traits for allowing us to complete the project on time and on budget. I really enjoyed that part of the the management. It was challenging, but also quite rewarding to actually bring people on board and see how they responded to the team environment. Once you were in the team environment then try to make sure each of their skills was used to the best of their abilities. So some people are a bit quieter but preferred to do technical tasks and I tried to encourage them to do that and other people were more into the social side of it. Are they engaging with the user base and things like that? And I tried to put them on two tasks that would fit with that skill set. I think another part of management is also to try and encourage people to think outside the comfort zones and and to interact in ways that maybe will be useful to them in the future. So I met with each member of the team at the very beginning and said, here's the project, these are the skills that you're bringing to, what would you like to do in order to develop your own skill base and maybe to learn from this project and to get something out of it beyond us, just delivering a project. Uh and I wanted to encourage them to think about how they could take their skills into other projects in the future as well as delivering well for this one, and I think people responded quite well to that. I think people like to feel engaged with their managers in a way that's not just a one directional thing that, you know, they have to deliver for them and have to bring them the parts of the projects that we've been assigned. It's quite nice for them to feel like they're managers, um not just managing the project and managing them, but also there to encourage them and their two to bring the team together and to try and get the best out of that and to try and get into their goals that they're looking for in the future. So I always try to um encourage them to feel that it's quite a flat structure. So remember my management style is a bit more casual and some I would hope that the people within my teams, I always feel like they can come to me and that I'll be telling them as much as I know, so that we've got a good communication streaming in both directions because it's very important within management to be able to um talk about issues that might arise without casting blame about and to all be able to go forward to get a solution together. Um and we did run into a few problems as with any project that lasted about six months. So all of that time, obviously you're gonna come across maybe, you know, systems being down, people not being available, changes in the user requirements, um just other changes within the organization. And I think as a manager, you have to make your team feel secure when they're delivering that they're doing a good job and that they can be, you know, part of the organization and contribute to it, but also they will have their personal goal as well, whether that's, you know, simply money from their job or social interactions from the job. And you have to also um as a manager, be aware of those differences in people and to see what motivates them and what can encourage them to do a good job for yourself and the organization. Um so I would say that my management and leadership skills are quite soft. I tend not to, I think that you get the best out of people by shouting at them or by making them feel scared of you, you obviously have to have some level of respect, but I would expect that I should respect that people are managing in the same way that they would respect me and in fact, across all peer levels as well. Um so a couple of the elements of management that I think could perhaps improve upon would be too get more into the social aspects of it. So in general, when I'm outside the work, I tend not to think about work or to try not to think about work. So perhaps if there's more team outings or things that would cause a bit more bonding within the team, and maybe I could be encouraged to improve my approach is to those in my suggestions within those and to bring people together, you know, in a social sense, as well as in a team building and team working sense within an organism.",POSITIVE,0.7411,0.0142,0.2438,0.001,912.0,HIGH,12,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),18.3,1,0,0,"Doctorate or professional degree (e.g. MD, DDS, PhD)",Female,9.333339,9.05852,8.871532

My name is Sarah Clanky and I am interested in a managing position in my field of work which is arts administration. I currently have a small amount of managing in my field as an arts administrator, I am a company manager of a dance company but my managing skills are small and on a smaller scale. I'm hoping to broaden my experience and become a managing position on a much larger scale. My skills include time management, work ethic and leading a team of people to success. I am a very hardworking person. I spend all of my time trying to make sure that I succeed. Not only that I succeed but my staff, my colleagues, employees and collaborators succeed. I believe that in order to be successful you need to expand and delegate efficiently so that everything can be accomplished effectively and I feel that I do a very good job of delegating tasks, checking in on everyone, making sure that deadlines are met. I'm very hard on deadlines. I am very good at remembering when things are coming up. Um I'm great at catching small mistakes or things that have been overlooked. So having me as your backup as your supporter and as the person who is encouraging you and making sure that everything is coming through smoothly and effectively is one of my strong suits. I would also say that one of my strong suits is communication. I want to over communicate. I do not want anyone to be left without the information that they need to succeed. I think over communicating is better than under communicating and so making sure that we have daily check ins a weekly staff meeting. Um I want to make sure that tasks are being handled well and if you have questions or problems or concerns that I am here to help you. Um I would like to see in a management position some more communication and I want to bring this to the table, so having these um tasks handed out to everyone and making sure that they were all on the same page, that there's no questions left to be unanswered or answered is something that I strive to achieve something else in my skills as a manager um would be work ethic. My work ethic is very strong, I like to take on small to do tasks and also big projects and I'm hoping as a manager that I can help delegate these tasks to employees and colleagues. You know, it takes a village to put together something spectacular and in arts administration it really does take a village cannot take one person and I fully understand that. So not letting all of the tasks or demands fall onto one person. We are a team and we can get through this together as a team if we spread out the tasks and we delegate and we work hard. I like to set deadlines. I like to have check ins, I like to make sure that my responsibilities have been completed so that you can do your responsibilities efficiently and effectively and I think that's the best key too. Management is I need to get my work done in order for you to get your work done. So my work ethic is very strong. I strive to get my task done each and every day and I really strive to hit deadlines. I think that applying for a management position for me is um something that I want to achieve in my long term career. Again like I said, I have small management um Della like I have small management tasks at the moment. Um but I'm really interested in doing something on a much bigger scale as a leader in the field, as a leader to a team and as a leader to myself and to the community around that we're serving. So I just want to thank you for your time again.

I have an outgoing personality but I know when and where to draw boundaries and to always keep them drawn, especially in the workplace. Should I be awarded this position? My approach would always be to maintain to establish and maintain an open office policy so that there is a certain level of freedom and transparency which also aids in productivity because they're happier employees are, the happier they are in the better they work. I also consider myself um intelligent and outspoken and confidentiality is also something that I take a lot of I'm pride in because I think it's also important to have, it's a trait as a personality trait that any manager should be able to have. Yeah I am trustworthy and honest. I am industrious and I always strive to do my best and all that I do.

Um two of these were in water conservation, which is the field that I have mainly worked in and one of them was as a newspaper editor at a large newspaper in Turkey. So the first two positions were in the States, one in California and one in colorado where I was tasked with hiring the teams that would work beneath me in the field in water conservation and then leading those teams in our tasks. So the tests were different. Um the two teams first hiring them, these were my first experiences with hiring people so that whole process but then um finding people that were compatible was interesting and getting them together. So when I actually had the teams together I was really looking for people who were going to work well with others, especially because they would be working with the public directly and in people's homes doing conservation and doing conservation audits. So the most important thing was really like their people skills and they're getting along with others and also being able to take direction and work independently. So my main goal when having a team is really that I know that I will not always be in a leadership position, so I am essentially taking on kind of a coaching mentoring role and also just like envisioning that some of the people beneath me are eventually going to be in my position. So developing there own skills and envisioning that they will eventually step up and be in a leadership, the same leadership position that I was in. So like I really envisioned myself as a mentor when I am leading, I want participatory type of leadership, I want to be kind of a coach, I want to be encouraging and really developing them. So I sent my team to various development conferences in conservation is really important to me that they like saw this as a stepping stone in their career as well. And so when I was at colorado in Aurora, the City of Aurora Conservation Department, that was like um hiring a new team every summer and so I would go and find the right people. We had a really good team in the last summer that I worked there um bringing them together, we had a lot of difficulties in terms of like the people that were developing the rules for that summer for auditing, we're constantly changing them. So it was a lot of pivoting and so it took a lot of encouragement with this team that was probably the most important as far as my role in leading that summer was just encouraging them getting past like the difficulty of constantly changing the rules that they would be adhering to in the field and so encouraging motivating was more of my role, so more of a coaching role and I find that that's where I am very comfortable is just being like a coach inspiring motivating people to do their best, even under difficult circumstances, which we were that summer. So um I find my greatest accomplishment and leading that summer was one of my main team members, Katie, who came on later in the summer, I actually trained her up to replace me when I left that position. And so like my role also, I see like in accomplishing that was that I feel like the people that you train to succeed you should exceed you, so like becoming even better than I was, because I'm not perfect and like I am a leader, but I can also train people, the fact that I can train people to do even better than me in that position, like they're younger, they're going I want them to be better. So I find that was probably my biggest accomplished was that Katie came in after me and she did exceed me, you know, she thought of things that I didn't think of and so I think that's also important in a leader, is to find this team that's going to be able to exceed you and like together we can really like bring a",NEUTRAL,0.104,0.1321,0.7558,0.008,702.0,HIGH,13,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),9.96,1,0,0,"Bachelor's degree (e.g. BA, BS)",Female,8.959115,8.681085,8.840322

If you don't communicate well with your staff, they will be confused, There won't be um understanding of what the task entails of them, therefore communication is one of my top priorities. Has been a manager as well as listening to your colleagues and employees. It's all well and good communicating with them, but if you don't listen then it's a bit pointless because they won't be able to try to collect themselves well during um job appraisals and other things throughout the day, especially during their task that they have to do. I also feel that it's important to motivate your staff. If you start every day on a high then once your staff feels a bit legend, they should feel that they have the ability to come and talk to you to feel more motivated to carry on their daily task setting motivation challenges around the workplace is also enough a good way to keep your staff motivated. For example saying the person That finishes their task by 2:00 PM gets a doughnut, that's a bit of motivation towards staff. It also provides team building activities for the staff to ensure that everyone else feels motivated, motivated and they're not alone. Um Be thankful to your staff, showing appreciation to your staff is also another way to motivate them, everyone knows and everyone feels hard day's works every now and then, so it's good to show your stuff that you are thankful for, the job that they've done and they are being recognized for their efforts, that they make every day. Um Another thing I would be as a manager is ensuring that I delegate delegating tasks throughout the day and ensuring that my team has um time management and they're aware of their strengths and weaknesses is a good way to delegate. Um It's a lot and a bit hard for all the managers to be the only ones doing the extra hard work. So it's good to yeah, delegate and ask your staff to do a certain amount of task because it will help for another day as well as it will help them. Um it gives the staff the opportunity to be able to manage their own outcomes, solve their own problems and work as a team as well. It also shows that as a manager or as management, I have trusted my employees that they can do the task that they have been asked to do, that, they are able to do the job that has been, that has they have been allocated for, or they have been employed to do and I think as a manager, it's just good to have positivity throughout the day, show your stuff that you're positive about the work they do everything they do.

The aspect of taking initiative, I come in with a plan, I come in with a level head into the office and I want to get the job done when I arrived, whatever, you know, whatever I have in mind, I want to get it done that day. So I come in, I take initiative, I sit people down, we talk, I have great communication skills, this is another aspect. Um I have something that makes a really good leader, so I think communication is important, I think listening is important. So I like to get the um the advice from my colleagues because I don't know all the answers I like to, you know, tell them what I'm thinking here, what they're thinking. Um I like to have a roundtable discussion kind of situation going on, I think that it's important to empower others while we're at that round table, but it's also it's important to critique their, you know, their ideas, but we should empower them as well, we should give credit where credit's due and we should motivate others to do their best and to really work on things that are going to make them shine and make the company shine and make each other shine. Um so in in a business scenario, making tough decisions, something we all deal with and as a leader making tough decisions is something that I'm willing to do. I think that whenever a leader does make tough decisions again, it's important to listen to the people around them, their colleagues, it's important to listen to people above, below on the same level. Um so making tough decisions and this is something I'm comfortable doing willing to do, but it's something that I will never do without the input of my colleagues and the people that I work with and work for. Um it's also another great thing leaders should always be able to do is to translate a vision into an action, we need to come in with a vision, but that's that's one thing, but we need to have a way a plan to make it work, we need to have the forethought to make the steps, write it down, get the input, we need talk to the people, we need to talk to get the numbers, I need, there has to be, the vision is great but we need more than just the vision. So that's another thing as a leader that I would say that I I'm good at doing, I'm good at taking the vision implementing what needs to be implemented and getting it done. So going off of that, that making the vision happen and in order to do that, I think it's also important and I brought up communication earlier, but as a leader it's important to communicate the vision in a way that is accessible for all types of learners and all types of people so um that it can be done to your colleagues and then it could be done to the public. And I think as someone who is leading a group or leading a vision, it's important that we have um these different types of learners in our back pocket, we have visual learners, auditory learners, kinesthetic learners, we have all these types of people who absorb information in different ways. And I think that it's really important to give them the info in a way that's easier for them to chew and digest. So we can all, we all start on, you know, an even playing ground and we'll have the best chance to make the vision a reality at the end of the day, so that's what makes me a good leader. Um I think if I was being led by somebody, I would want somebody who knows that being a leader is just as much about being a follower in a way, being a contributor to the overall good of others, it's, you know, being a leader is not easy, being a leader is the hardest job.

In the past, I've managed uh an administration department with over 10 employees and during this time I was able to do a number of changes in that department. For instance, I was able to reduce the procurement turnaround period by 25%. I was able to implement new systems of tracking mhm. All procurement, I was able to introduce the procurement tracker to all departments at the same time, I was also able to provide training to all this stuff in the organization. What makes me the best candidate is that I have experience in both administration and finance. I am able to use this together with my academic experience in financial technology and I use this as a way to improve my managerial skills. Being a manager is not just about academic experience, but it's also about being able to understand and know what the stuff you have under you can do and to make use of their skills. This the best way is to look at the skills that they have, assign different tasks to them and once you assign those tasks, you then help them, you grew them and you also become a mentor to them over the years. I've learned that I also have mentors who have helped me be to the position where I am right now and because of that, I believe that I can also be a mentor to those who are also under me, Those that are under me, I'm able to listen to them, not just on a work level, but as well as a personal level use of because of this, it means that I'm able to understand them if they're going through any problems that they may be having and as a staff member, as an employee myself, I always understand and know that and hope that those that I work with will be able to communicate to me not just about the work that they're doing, but also about their personal lives. At the end of the day, the personal life of an individual affects how they perform at work and understanding this will make it easier for me to know how I can help them, how can adjust the work that they need to do as a manager. Also I feel that you also need to have training. You cannot just be a manager who has not been trained in managing stuff, You need to be able to know how to do it, you need to be able to know what is expected from you, you need to be able to understand the job that you're doing and this is the first thing that I do. I go through the policies, I go through the the organizational chart, I go through everything that is provided by the organization. Once I understand the organization, I'll know how I can use my soft skills and how I can use my academic skills to make sure that I am able to prosper and make it through as the manager. I would wish that you consider me for this managerial position because I feel that I have a lot to give um in terms of where I've worked before, in terms of what I've done before and in terms of what I'm able to bring to the table, I'm able to learn from what the organization has at the moment and what I can also support and bring to the table. Thank you so much for taking this opportunity to go through and understand and hear what I have to say.

It's great to have the opportunity to speak to you about this role in more detail and showcase why I think I'd be a great fit for this position? I truly enjoy working with people. I think that is at the root of any successful manager worker relationship, because actually it's all about understanding what are the drivers and what are the motivators For your staff, especially given the current climate. We have organizations have had to adapt so quickly, especially given the last 20 months, two years related to the pandemic. And so actually what becomes really important is your ability to truly understand what motivates your staff and what they're looking for. So you need to take that step back, hold a mirror up to see where your organization is going, but more importantly, where the senior management team in that organization and the middle management team are actually taking everyone happily from this position. I think it's really quite crucial then that you can showcase your leadership skills and make sure that everyone is engaged because people are the key to your organization. You want to keep this engagement level. You want to make sure that they are feeling valued and supported and that's where the role of the manager comes in, As I mentioned earlier, you really do need to get to know your workforce, you need to know their motivations, their dreams, you know, what are their drivers and also what their thoughts are around progression or what is important to them from a career perspective. Do they want to end up in your role and sexually so you're always constantly building on that point or is it the case of they're happy where they are but they want to up skill so each individual is different and what you can't do in a management role is assumed that everyone would want exactly the same um degree of management or the same kind of 1-1 contact. You know and we work hybrid. Now there's that remote working as the on site. So actually it's about, well do you check in with that person? Some people are quite happy with a loose amount of contact but you do need to put in place a structure that is effective for them and their career development. I think I am from my own background I am an executive coach and there's a difference where you allow the coaching side to come in with the management and your leadership skills essentially the coaching allows you to upscale your um team, you're working with individuals and showing them a wider armory to ensure that they're able to deal with a situation that may arise in the workplace by doing this. They then take the tools with them and they can showcase that and you know use that with others. Um And you really want to get to the nitty gritty I think that you'll see the whole idea of leadership and coaching and management all come together within the E. V. P. So the employer value proposition of your organization. If you're in an organization that really does value their staff, they talk to you about where you could be going from a career progression point of view and you're going to get people that are more involved in you and actually they buy in more to your organization, a happier team, therefore will stay longer and you will be able to pass on these skills to the next individual through that team. The constant level of development is what you want. You want someone that feels um enthused, motivated, happy driven um and all together I think um focused on what comes next. So the whole point about this is to say that I come from a background where I've had numerous um managers in terms of their different styles. Each person's style is different, but as with anything, you don't get a second chance to make a first impression. So what you want to do is get to know and understand what are the key issues or key thought processes, anything that was really going to stand in the way or affect how your leadership goes down. I think this is about having an open door policy. You can't sit there in your ivory tower. I think it's very important, important to be approachable to be open to actually talk about your experiences as well, but not to the detriment of others. So you may be the lead person that people come to, but you want to hear about them. As I said before, it's stoking that engagement, stoking that trust building, that report. You need time to do that and you can't just assume because you're a manager, someone is going to respond to you, they will be respect there, but it works both ways and that is a constant communication point that you need to work together to draw out and bring together. I think why I would make a fantastic candidate is that, you know, there's so many different areas in which I'm aware of and familiar with, you know, managed before and I've really enjoyed it and I think it's actually one of those things where it's a learning process, you're not the finished article ever, you as well as the individual will learn together. And that shows a lot about the growth of your relationship, the strength of what you can bring and why that is, you know, why the organization will flourish and go from there.

Um I can also work with the other managers, we can share our ideas are most open to listen to other people's ideas, I don't just go with what I have to say, everyone's bringing different things to the table. Um Likewise, I bring my skill Welcome within my field, so that's something that I would bring to this role as well, I've been in the field, although I've been managing for three years I've been in the field for about 10 years, so I have so much knowledge that I'm willing to share.

Um in terms of experience, I first started working in accounts in 2008 I was at that point I worked for a company called my park and I was a a farmed assistant and my role basically involved purchase ledger work um raising purchase orders, matching invoices into the system for payments, doing stock takes and things like that. I didn't really have a great deal to do with deal with any other aspect other than that but it really was that that sort of fueled my interest in deciding to pursue a career in accounts later on um I worked there for several years before I took a year out. Um I actually moved up to Sheffield to be my partner and in that time I decided that I wanted to start studying for a formal qualification and move from. Mhm. A job where purchase leisure was a small aspect of what I do to accounts, being the main focus of what I do really. Um So what I did then is I started my account undertaking my accounts qualifications which I did as part of home learning, I did that for over a year. I got my um advanced level too certificate and in that time I started mostly focused at taking part time jobs in order to build up my experience in order to experience of dealing with finance on on a daily basis. So my first position that I got, I worked, it was a temporary position I worked for complete charity called, I'm Mickey, the Institution of Mechanical Engineering. Um I actually went there as an admin assistant but they found out that I was interested in accounts could do some accounts, so they actually asked me if I would stay on as an accounts assistant from the six months helping the main financial accountant. I was in charge of the logging all invoices came in the day books, looking after the mhm. The ledger accounts and the credit accounts for two companies because they own two companies at the time, making sure that expenses were checked every day, preparing invoices for payment run, making sure that was signed off by management. And I did that for about six months but it was only a temporary position. Um So again in that time I wanted to carry on gaining more experience. Well getting my qualification because I didn't feel I had enough experience at the time to go for a permanent job. Um And what I wanted to do, so next I ended up working for the comfortable fulcrum who deal with gas installations and again, I worked in accounts payable there, I was dealing with all the invoices that were coming in, scan them into the system, I was dealing with aggregates there and trying to get delivery notes and matching them to orders on the systems of the clear up the payment. Uh double checking all the invoices that came in on on the ledger. And I also did a bit of that's where I first came across doing some a bit more credit control than I've done before because I was asked to cover um leave for someone who left unexpectedly. So I did that. Um my next position was over a year. I went to an extra on a three month contract but was there for a year and that was casual location. So that was mostly credit control to be honest. But it was interesting because I hadn't done that as much as I've done purchased letter in my career. Um Again allocating payments into invoices, very tight deadlines covering bank accounts all across europe different currencies and converting them. Um And then I became to GFS l a few years ago, three years ago where I came in as an accounts payable assistant a year and a half after that I was acting accounts payable supervisor In 2019 I became the permanent account supervisor for GFS cell, which is where I've been ever since.

Uh there are a number of reasons I think I'd be a strong candidate for a leadership position within your organization. Firstly, I have strong communication skills. Um I worked in a number of positions that have involved multidisciplinary collaboration and have utilized strong communication skills throughout those. For example, I worked in a hospital where I was a social worker for people, um responding, they're in crisis. And in that position I needed to communicate the client's condition two doctors and two nurses who often had limited time available and where um there was high stakes and a lot of different kind of contexts and where it was new people in and out all the time. So, um really establishing quick report and positive relationships right from the beginning and having a clear understanding of what I needed to communicate to them and the hierarchy of needs within that. It was really important. I also have a conflict resolution skills in another one of my positions I worked with victims in the criminal justice system and in that position I worked with in the courts. And so I had to manage expectations from clients and from lawyers within the court system. So often there was different uh types of values or different things that were important to people throughout that process. And part of my job was to help manage expectations and come to conflict resolution um together. So to do that, I often would look for what we had in common for our hopes with the people we are working with. So for example, myself and lawyers often wanted um clients to be stable and be doing okay. And so I would draw upon that when we were trying to collaborate together and work together to come to an understanding. So again, just looking for commonalities, even across sort of diverse groups, and then starting from that as a basis to move forward, helped with our conflict resolution. Additionally, I've had previous experience with in leadership. So as a social worker, I've managed social work students before, so I've had placement students completing their masters of social work, come to the agency in which I work and part of my position there was to take care of some of the supervisory details. So things like onboarding, um providing feedback throughout their experience, both informal and formal. Um getting them used to sort of the steps in the job and connected to the right people and then helping them out with the client termination at the end and then their own off boarding. So I was with them from start to finish. And I've also supervised volunteers within a bunch of different social work positions. And so those are more time limited, but also just exciting opportunities to use some managerial skills. And finally, I have been in the field for over a decade now. So I do have a strong basis to my knowledge in the social work field. I have worked with people in numerous contacts and across a lot of large age range. So I feel really confident in my skills and social work. For example, I've worked with kids as young as I say, probably two or three up to older adults. I've worked in certainly a lot of non profit organizations and also some for profit organizations. I've worked virtually with clients and in person with clients. I've worked with families and individuals and groups. Um, so I feel confident in my ability to utilize my my skills as a social worker.

So the first thing would be project management experience. So not just looking at direct line management and not just working with individuals but also from project side of things. So we had a big project that I worked on was actually the redevelopment of a website. And this involved the full um break down and rebuild and bringing a new content existing content that's getting refreshed and working with stakeholders across the organization to make sure that we're producing the best content in the best way. Um Also looking at kind of the interaction side of things and how things worked. Um In terms of kind of buttons when they clicked on and making sure that they reacted appropriately and then looking at user feedback that we gathered to help steer the decision making process whilst we did this. Um So when I did the project when I led it I worked with stakeholders from across the organization who came from very very different roles. So working with technical and skilled roles. So engineers and architects in the I. T. And technology services area but then also working with more administration staff who work directly kind of front line with clients with students with colleagues. Um And then also I'm kind of working with them independently to figure out their strengths and weaknesses. Figure out what they need from the project, figure out how they can help the project, how they can contribute to the project and then kind of working with them to fill the gaps that they couldn't remove any blockers and figure out their personal time scales, deadlines, if they work on things in their team that for example the time of year, they might be particularly busy trying to kind of factor that into the project, so we can give that team a little bit longer or maybe give them a bit more guidance and support in getting things done and potentially you might have been working with people again across the organization to support one another, incredible, create kind of peer support groups to work on that. I am just to ensure that we can get the product delivered on time to sue the wider organization, but also the people who work on it happy and comfortable and they're managing to get the job done for themselves as well. Um on the other hand, I have also worked as a team lead um and as a line manager directly working one on one support people, so from that side of thing, outside of the kind of leadership and scale, I've kind of looked at more of the pastoral support, so making sure people were completing the paper, we're excited things effectively, making sure time sheets were completed and also, if they weren't taking leave and they were working over there hours, they can show asking why, making sure they were okay. So you understand any issues, any things that I could remove potentially blocking there and journey or their development or making them over work when they shouldn't have to and also just kind of like the kind of real pastoral support sides and making sure for well being perspective they were okay and they were managing to get their jump done effectively balance work, home life and all of that comes with it and beyond the kind of leadership and managerial side of things and the skills I bring tend to be around um looking at creative solutions to problems thinking outside the box, making sure that people feel supported and that kind of stakeholder engagement side of things to really kind of progress things forward, regardless of what it is, it might be a very, very small project, it might be a logical redevelopment and whatever the problem is, I will think creatively work with people, get user feedback and get user research and help that and take that to shape the decisions that I make, that help move things forward. And I'd also say that I have with the experience that I have and both in projects both in redevelopment, Also in the kind of stakeholder management side and the leadership projects and then the leadership of 1-1 support and unique individuals and making the step up takes me more into the strategic side of things, which are starting to tap into that, it's something that I really, really like. I'm moving further away from the actual doing side of things and more in that leadership and that kind of taking things further, figure out what would be best for the organization as a whole and how to get there. Let's start about actually doing that. But also, but delegating the tasks out and implementing the change across the board.

Um That's where I did my studies and I made it in Physics, the physical sciences, life sciences and accounting and mathematics. So I've always been a very um sort of straight A students because from a very young age I was very dedicated to my books. I would do my homework all the time, make sure that my assignment um are done before the due date. Um Just because I think I've always been very ambitious and very um aware of what I want in my life and for my future and therefore being aware of the fact that I need to get to work very hard um in order to get there to make sure that I am not lacking in my studies to make sure that I'm focusing in class. When was anything that is, in short, I'm taking down my nose. Um Yeah, so academically um I would say I was shocked and I also took part in many extracurricular activities at this sports. I did shocker. I did hockey, I did volleyball ideas software as a very active person that helped me to gain um communication skills to gain interpersonal skills, gain technical skills. Um And I was actually a captain for um soccer and Hockey. So I would say it really taught me how to be affirmative when talking to people, getting your message through people, making sure that they understand was required of them, and but also making sure that you understand their needs as well and how they feel, because it's a two way relationship, it's not um one side and you have to make sure that your employees or your staff or your team, um you guys are working together because there is more unity and more, I'd say progression and success when there is um sort of like um synergy and everybody's working together, so it really taught me how to to be a team player almost, which I think is a great skill in the business world, and as a manager, you need to understand how people think um and also different kinds of people, because during all those sports we got to travel through different provinces cities and we got to see different cultures and see how different types of people think so in this world, diversity is very important. So it's I think it's a great thing was skill to know how different cultures, I think so that you can sort of like mend that together when it comes to the business world. Um Yes, I'm as I said, I'm majoring in marketing, so one of the modules that I'm doing is actually five, I'm doing economics, um I'm doing business management, marketing management, stakeholder relations, and commercial law, So they develop content in that which will help me in this job in the marketing place because like I said, I know how customers think um from a a social point of view, but because of um I agree that I'm doing, I can also get the content sort of like the very detailed um explanation on on all of these things, you know, because we learn about customer relationships to learn about um uh hierarchy needs and all of those things where what is needed. You learn about um organizational, organizational culture and how the organization works economics to learn about the economy. You learn about um sales are down about uh demand and supply. So I say I'm very skilled in that aspect as well, so content wise, but also um socially in terms of the people that I'm working with, so I think that I am the best candidate for this job um because I love people love communicating with people, but at the same time um I have the content and the skills that is needed in order to get my message across.

I also have experience as a volunteer at a canoe safari where it's my responsibility to um take the payments from all the visitors to the center. I had to explain and deliver all the safety talks to the visitors so that they were aware of how to get into the canoe safely, how to move the canoe safely, what to do in the event of capsizing at canoe.

Um but I think my main experience in the leadership role is as a gcc massachusetts. So for the last two years I have been so gcc s year 12, so ages 15 and 16. So for the last two years I have been um doing GCSE maths tutoring. So I have talked Over 10 students and delivered over 110 lessons across the two years.

Um and then I deliver the hour long lesson to the students where we go through the theory of the topics on their syllabus, go through examples and exam questions for the exam practice and then just sort of iron out any creases in their work, dusting off the cobwebs essentially. Um and then after the lessons, I write up a lesson report for the parents, so it's just a summary of what was covered in the lesson, what the student, so there child, what they did well what they coped well with essentially what their strengths are. So it was up to me to sort of identify strong points in the student and give feedback on that. So give encouragement where the students doing well. I also had to detail the weaknesses of the students. So topics, they struggled on questions, they struggled on all aspects of exam questions that they struggled with and how the student can improve this. So sort of suggestions for revision or whether it's just doing more practice or trying to think of it in a whole new way, and then finally the report um included um an outline of what we'll cover in the next lesson. So usually are sort of pick bits in the previous lesson, where the students struggled to focus on that more so that as we go along, each stage of working gets um properly fine tuned.

So when we think about leadership skills, we can consider them as the ability or abilities that are used in an organization in order to organize people with the, with the main aim of reaching a common goal. Now I recognize having skills enable me to provide my team with clear instructions, delegate responsibilities, set objectives. But most importantly what I think and why I think that I am the best candidate for this role is that out of all of those whilst I acknowledge that they are important, I think a key skill that is required is this notion of motivating individuals, motivating individuals so that we can work effectively and efficiently in order to manage deadlines. Now when I think about leadership, I recognize that actually it covers a huge amount of different attributes, but I think the top leadership skills that I possess in terms of what makes me a good leader and what it will make me a good leader for your organization, surround the areas of I have a key goal setting and planning skills. So I'm able to be involved in order to establish small or large scale objectives that most importantly will relate to the larger good of the organization. So amongst this goal setting and planning planning skills are those that I would use to create a series of smaller goals and these smaller goals are almost like milestones that lead to reaching the larger objectives. Now the reason I set the smaller goals is so that with their realistic they're based on resources that were then able to assign tasks to individual members so that we are all so that we all feel like we are contributing towards that common objective. Another key skills that I possess is communication. Now when I think of communication skills, I mean being able to write, listen, speak and present information to others in a clear and efficient way, but also in a motivational way that enables us to determine the best mode of communication for specific messages. So for example the difference between an email and also communicating in in a in person. Another key skill that I think is important is delegation. So being able to assign tasks to others including task that myself to myself that I know recognize that needs completing, I don't feel like I'm above any of my team members, so if I feel like I can contribute to the task, I will delegate the job to myself. Okay, and I think the key thing here that I think will be a value to your organization is that I have a key skill of being able to select the best team member for the task and being able to provide them with clear instructions, dependability and integrity are the two key skills that I think are fundamentally important. So when I think of dependability, being able to refer to being someone the others can trust and they can trust in me to complete a task at hand and on time. But also I want my team to feel like that they can come to me when help is needed. And I think as part of this, what's really important is having a key behavior or a standard of behavior and work ethics such as punctuality, kindness and motivation and integrity, essentially being able and well let me start that again and being, having integrity of what's most important to me and so being able to be honest and sticking to my morals regardless of the pressure that we as a team, a renda okay. And that means that if I made a mistake, I'm accountable for my mistakes or actions and I'll leave and held myself accountable for their teams, errors or downfalls because we are all working towards that common objective.

Over the many years I progressed to being a classroom teacher And then to a member of the senior management team. Whereas over 40 other teachers within the school um I had to manage their curriculum time and ensure that they were teaching the correct curriculum to their age group of Children. Since I finished as a classroom teacher. five years ago I took a role as a county advisor um in educational special needs. In this role I manage the educational special needs of Children in mainstream schools that management enter entails. Me supporting the scent coz within those schools and in this area where I'm currently teaching, we have about 150 schools. Obviously I'm not the only person in this position but I can be called in to any of those schools where I am initially see the head of the school, then liaise with the same code of the school, the classroom teacher and the teaching assistants who are supporting the child that has the educational learning and difficulties I um observe the child initially and then write a report of what I've observed and my recommendations as how that child should be should be accommodated within the classroom the stuff then within the school have a legally binding obligation to fulfill the recommendations that I have written. Um and it is my job to then revisit the school and the child within a certain time limit to ensure that my recommendations has been carried out. Obviously it's quite a sensitive issue because you don't want to go in criticizing and I know that everybody nearly in every school are doing their very best. So I am envisaged my role when I go into school as being supportive because some of the Children that the schools have are not easy to accommodate in a mainstream setting, so I feel that I'm going to support them. I want to be open, I'm very open to taking ideas off them and developing them with the members of staff. I don't feel that I know more than anybody else, but I have a lot of different ideas and maybe a lot more experience that I can offer to them.

Um I would say leadership is a form obviously of management, so it helps to keep like a team together. Obviously you've got to divide your tasks up equally. Why has there been no, like nothing really get into? I also see leadership as like a way of teaching people like you're going to work your way through with them because you're going to teach them what they need to do. Um It's a way of guiding them. So you you want to guide them to be able to get the best from them, you want to get the best of their abilities to be able to benefit what you wanted them to do. And leadership kind of just stops chaos in general. To me, leadership is important because you need that guidance, especially if you've got a big team, you need the team to be able to be on the same headspace, They need to know where they're at what they need to do and be able to prepare and work together to be able to get everything done personally. I work in retail, so my style of leadership would be getting everyone to work together and you guide people that don't really necessarily know what they're doing, but you do it in a way to help them improve and to get them to do how you need to do that and I would also say that leadership is a good place to be as you've got to be confident, you've got to understand how people work. You've got to be someone that people can rely on. People are going to want to follow you. If you're not someone that can rely on, if you're not trusted, then that was just creating a horrible place is you're not going to have that progression coming from them. People, leadership to me also is Mhm. Working with people so that they can build up their steps so you've got like the ladder almost so they might start at the bottom, but eventually they're going to build their way up and that's obviously so they can get to where they want to be in life. You don't just start something and then end it there. You've got to keep progressing and hopefully that's what they will do. For instance, I've been training the new guys at work recently and when I train them, we have to make sure obviously that they're confident. They know how to speak to consumers that they know what to do next, they need to know how to do that, but be happy doing it. They need to feel comfortable. But also feel like if they've got any questions that they can come ask them, you don't want them to feel like they don't know what they're doing and that's what leadership is all about. Like you're teaching them the way, but doing it in a way that they understand and feel comfortable, you don't want to just force it on them, you lied in them. So it's almost like guidance rather than being, this is how you're going to do it, you're going to be a robot. Um Another thing I'd say about leadership is it means that things can get done more productively, so you've got things like if you've got a task and you've got three people on it, but there's no leader, then they're not necessarily going to know where to start or how to plan it out and it might get done a lot slower. Whereas if you've got a task and and I will get a leader who's going to show them what they're doing, talk it through divide the work, then they're going to be able to get on with what they're getting on with the lead, is going to be able to allocate the work to the people, it needs to go to the people that are best at that job, which ultimately means you're going to get better work from them as well.

So it's great to talk to you today and hopefully get paid for the study on prolific just to introduce myself a little bit. My name is lucy um and I'm currently working as a covid 19 test assistant in a local asymptomatic test center in Central Westminster. Um It's very busy tourist center and I'm here to just explain a little bit today and talk about some of the leadership skills that I've gained from that and explain why I think I would be a good candidate for a managing position in a similar role. Um So first and foremost, um I have leadership experience from my current role. I worked for a short time period of around six months supervising a team of seven. They included managing their schedules, training them mentoring them, conducting quality control on the testing that we were doing. Um essentially making sure the center runs smoothly. Um so I enjoyed leadership. I'm proud to say that two out of those seven people were promoted into more senior roles while I was mentoring them. Um I think um an example of a situation where I demonstrated some leadership skills and abilities was in increasing the number of people who came in to be tested at the center was when I started there in january 2021 testing grades among the local population were actually relatively low. We were conducting around about 10 tests today, which obviously in terms of pandemic control and prevention was not ideal. Um so I actually instituted a new project where by me and my team would go out and distribute fliers in the local area, would conduct outreach talks in local libraries, local churches, local centers. Um and I'm pleased to say that that project was successful and that we managed to actually increase the number of people who were getting tested every day from 10 To around 30 a day at the end of my tenure at that particular center. Um, so I feel like one of the most important aspects of leadership is actually the ability to be an effective team member and like every leader is part of a team. So you've got to really focus on supporting others in the role that you can't just be stuck in the back office or keep out of the way you have to be there alongside your team, like testing. Um or for instance in my role conducting tests personally as well, um assisting people with customers who have say, language issues or have complaints. Um, it's always your role to support your team and to step in and make life easier for them to take a very sort of hands on approach. Um and I feel like that's a really important facet of leadership and leadership style. Um the other thing is perhaps knowing when to um sweat the small stuff as it were and when to let people get on and do their own thing, Like take a more laid back approach. So for instance, one of the technically developed was not micromanaging my team, trusting that they had the skills and the resources and the knowledge to for instance scan test results in themselves, they're not constantly being covering over them, not constantly sitting around the table where covid test results are reported and sort of scanning every test myself and sort of, you know and making it so that you know that was my role and I'm the only one and I'm the only person who can do that now. Um I had it more so where I trusted my team to input these results and then did quality control at the end of the day and obviously if there was a mistake I would step in and correct it. Um but I feel like by taking a step back in that approach or in that respect, I could actually make the center and smither because I had more time to focus on other aspects of the role for one thing and also other people gain the skills and the confidence that they needed in order to help the center run effectively in one of our core functions",POSITIVE,0.7129,0.0078,0.2789,0.0005,704.0,HIGH,14,99.0,2.0,Using only (2),11.08,1,0,0,"Bachelor's degree (e.g. BA, BS)",Female,7.641401,7.395613,7.294244

And so currently I'm working at a two year institution, but I also have previous experience working at a four year institution as well. And I have been working in the area of admissions since 2019 when I graduated with my bachelor's degree. Um and the degrees that I completed in college was business management, human resources and risk management and then also psychology. So I did have three separate degrees that I completed in my college experience. And so what I'm highlighting within this question is I am highlighting my leadership abilities um and then also my management skills that will make me the perfect fit for this position. And so starting off with my experience with an admissions as I said, I have been in this position since 2019 as an emissions rep um and I have gone between two different types of institutions and so within that time I've held multiple leadership roles and also helped take on multiple projects, especially working through covid. Um It did cause a little bit of stress during that time but um it was a great learning experience and also helping build up my adaptability skills are working in this realm. But within my professional position currently I have helped manage student ambassadors on campus. I have helped organize events on campus and also organized events on my own such as a counselor visit day in which we invite all of our guidance counselors on a campus. Um Also recruiting events such as collaborating with the athletics department to bring students not only to a sports game on campus, but to also bring them in to discuss admissions materials as well. And then on top of that I also have had responsibilities of managing marketing materials. And so that included uh collaborating with the marketing department to produce a view book for the school in which we'll use for pretty much all of our recruiting events on that includes college fairs, high school visits, um visits to campus. And so when students first see us, this is the first promotional material that they have and it pretty much gives them an overview of everything about the college, at least that they'll need to know for the time being when they start their process into exploring colleges and then on top of creating that uh type of promotional materials. I also help um with collaborating with other departments such as the different schools that we have on campus and creating promotional materials for them, collaborating again with the athletics department to create promotional materials um And these promotional materials that I'm talking about include brochures or little booklets that we have for them that not only those schools are the athletics department can use for themselves, but we can also use um as we go out recruiting and then on top of all that working in my professional staff position. Currently I have the I currently manage all of my students within my territory. And that includes talking with parents and students introducing them to the school, um working them through the admissions cycle, which includes uh admissions, working through financial aid, getting them enrolled in classes and then also getting them onto campus. But besides my professional experience that I have, that makes me a great candidate for this position. I also have previous experience, leadership experience throughout college that aids me um and getting these skills as well. And so throughout college I did also work in the admissions office as a student worker and so I helped guide tours. Um I helped with recruiting events on campus and I also traveled a little bit along with the recruiters going to those events. Um I also worked at the library and manage my own projects for a couple of years. And so that included managing archive materials for the schools, collaborating with historians, and also newspapers within the area to gather materials for them to use for their projects or their articles that they were working on. Um And then also managing bigger projects such as um doing inventory within the library, and then also reorganizing the library and creating events. And then on top of that I have quite a bit of retail experience to working in retail was my biggest job throughout college. And so I held supervisor rules. I helped close down to different stores, which was an interesting experience. Um And then on top of all that, I did hold multiple jobs um throughout college. And so I was working at the library, uh working in retail, and then also working as a student at the time. And so with the experience that I have all together, I believe that this makes me the perfect candidate for this role.

So because of all of that experience, I now have incredibly strong leadership skills and I believe that that makes me the ideal candidate for this role. So to give some examples in the past, I've been tasked with leading huge products, products that were incredibly important for the business that I was working within, and I was solely and fully accountable for these projects. Um and the most important part of leadership I found in those projects was all about ensuring that all of the moving parts are working together. So you need to be incredibly organized, you need to look at the whole picture and ensure that everyone involved is doing what they should be doing and in the time frames that you need them to be doing it. I have got a proven track record of delivering massive projects in time and on budget. I think one of the key reasons, probably the main reason actually is due to the great leadership on my part of the team involved, I've had a number of different reports in my teams previously, I've always worked really well with all of those people. Um they've always looked up to me and worked well with me as their leader and consistently performed extremely well. Um so I've always made sure to take the time to get to know them to understand them and understand where they want their career to go, so make sure they're getting out of their job what they want to, and I'm getting from them what I need to. So um sitting down, working on personal development plans, reviewing them regularly, it's really, really important for getting the best out of people really, and actually many of them have gone on to be promoted several times and they would tell you, and they have told me actually that it's down to the great leadership and guidance that I gave them early in their career. Um and my door is always open um and often they will come back to me and as can be for advice in the future because they trust me, they trust my opinion um as as the leader in the past. Um So they want my advice from time to time and I'm always willing to give that and I don't think there's a greater testament to your abilities as a leader. Someone people count on them coming back to you when they've got no ties to you really. Um And asking for your advice, I've led my department successfully for a number of years, consistently being the highest performing team in the business. And again, that's all down to my great leadership and we are an incredibly well respected and valued team and in turn I am a well respected and valued leader due to my results that can't really be argued with, so from my experience, I would say the most important aspect of leadership is I meet your respect, you've got to show your team whoever they are, whatever job they're doing, whatever level there are, that you respect and value them because you need them. Um And in turn they will respect you. Um And only then can you achieve the best possible outcomes and you also have the least stress or resistance possible. You know what you're trying to achieve, Your team needs to trust you, and then they'll also trust that your decisions or whatever you're asking them to do are the right thing for the task in hand.

First one that will be explaining and talking about is uh planning. Planning is a vital aspect within an organization. It refreshes to one's ability to organize this activity in line with set guidelines while still remaining within the limits of the available resources such as time, money and labor. So as the manager of this company. For me it is also a process of formulating a set of actions or one or more strategies to pursue and achieve certain goals or objectives within the available resources. Again, planning process includes identifying and setting achievable goals, developing necessary strategies and outlining the task and schedules on how to achieve the set goals Without a good plan, little can be achieved. So planning is the most important skill that me is the manager applied for this position. I will make the company to go for what I will achieve so many things for the company. And another vital management skill is decision making managers can make numerous decisions whether knowingly or not. And making decisions is a key component in manages success, making proper and right decision results in the success of the organization. Will pour orbit decisions may lead to failure or poor performances by the manager and that could damage the company. It could damage the company's reputation or it can even bring a company to fail. A company can even fail. Another one is delegation. A delegation is is another key management skill, delegation is the act of pursing on work related tasks and authorities to other employees or subordinate. It involves the process of allowing your task or those of your employees to be re assigned or allocated to other employees. Depending on current workloads. A man of the manager area. Manager with uh good delegation skills is able to effectively and efficiently reassign tasks and give authority to the right employees so that the company cannot fail. And another one is problem solving. I I love this one. Problem solving is an essential scare. So a manager, a good manager must have an ability to tackle and solve problems frequently so that can arise in a typical workday problem solving. You know managers uh duties and and and it involves identifying a certain problem or situation and then finding the best way to handle the problem and get the best solution. So um the last question it was why am I the best candidate for this question? I I believe that I am the best candidate for this position because I am fit for the job and capable of delivering excellent results. I possess skills that are unique and likely unteachable would make, which makes me and above average candidate. I am hard worker and can work under pressure in all circumstances. I'll be an asset to the company in a perfect fit for the team. Thank you.

I like to think of my management style as more of a hands off approach. Um I'm not there to be there there, I'm not there to be their mother in a sense where I will be helicoptering over them and micromanaging but instead I like to provide them with the tools that they can use to excel in their job. So I have As a non manager mentor over 10 analysts who have gone on to successfully integrate into their roles in their teams and gone on to have pretty good careers um at our company and I have had to direct reports so far and um I would say both have been pretty good examples of what I can do. Both of them have managed to excel in their roles and I give them a lot of independence and reward their ingenuity at work. Some examples of why I would be a good manager, not just people but of work. I have led and completed a large global scale project Two introduced a new system used across three functions in the company which involves H. R.. Procurement and finance. It was a success, we integrated it across these three functions across I think it was 50 countries that we operated and not only that um Once I was done with that project I moved to another project where um my primary goal was to create a um a training program for juniors in the company and in this role. Not only did I plan and design this training program, but I also executed it. Um not as the trainer but a facilitator for the trainers, I organized the training. So I think these these two points show that I am very good at managing projects and what is a team, if not a group of people who are focused on delivering on a project, the project goals and the project's missions. So I think um with my proven track record of executing work and getting the job well done paired with my skills of being a people person, I would be a good fit for this role. I have also worked in a very, very large company of over 100,000 companies as 100,000 employees Across like I said 50 countries and I think this provides me with very very good diverse skills.

I worked for an engineering company and I was test engineer and then became a young manager. And as part of a management training program which included a number of modules around communication skills, understanding team dynamics and motivation. I was particularly interested in understanding how to motivate our team who had to work a lot of shifts. So working unreasonable hours at times, weekends and holiday periods and long shifts. Sometimes I've built on my early skills through my work and I have a good understanding of how to build teams, how to make those teams efficient and how to create what reward packages which really motivate the team members.

Hi, um my name is Laura and I am going to tell you all about my leadership abilities Um and I guess I will start off with the job that I currently have which is a teacher. Um I have been in this profession for about 25 years now and um I am a leader within my small team um at my job I teach gifted and talented, um I'd gifted and talented resource teacher. So not only am I teaching students that are in the elementary school, but I am also teaching the teachers how to um enhance their teaching um for students that need a little bit of differentiation. So um I am the leader of my gifted and talented team, one other person is under me and he comes to me for various things on a weekly basis, um ideas for lessons um just to run things by me um that he emails to parents. Um He has been in the job half the time as I have, so he looks up to me for um for some guidance at times um also being a teacher, um I am definitely a leader because I am able to help other teachers, like I mentioned earlier differentiate for their students who need a little bit of extra work and a little bit of extra um rigor during their um during the time that they're working. Um I am also um someone that is a really good friend and um I think that I have very good leadership is being a good friend because people come to me because they also know I'm a very good listener. I've also had a lot of life experiences um that some other people haven't, so I think that people look towards me um in order to get some questions answered, whether it be about being married or having Children. Um also um when people want to change jobs a lot of times, some of my friends will ask me how I did that because I didn't change um the field that I'm in, I'm I'm still in education, but I went from being a regular classroom teacher to a resource teacher, which kind of is a big jump in education. Um you have a little bit more responsibility when you do that, and um people look at me as a leader because I actually did make that jump and have been successful with it. Um I also feel like I have leadership abilities because I am an athlete. Um I was on a division one volleyball team many, many moons ago um and I was actually the captain of my team um in college um where once again, people were looking up to me, people were asking me um you know, to show them how to do things. My coaches looked to me to be the leader on the floor during the volleyball games. Um I was actually one of two captains on the team, um but I was actually the one that was supposed to go actually talk to the referees and be the one to sort of, um, rally my team to try to win games. I'm also a mother and um, being an athlete in college, I took that very seriously and I continued my being healthy. I'm in my upper forties right now and I go to the gym five days a week and my younger daughter who's actually a sophomore in college, she is an athlete as well. And I do know, even though she might not admit it, she does look up to me to see what kind of athlete I am and um, tries to, you know, eat healthy like I do and go to the gym a lot. Um, she does a little bit more harder exercises than I do, but I'm still there every day trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Um, and I know that she does look up to me with eating habits and being active. Um, I'm also a daughter and a sister to my family. And um, I just think that I am the one that kind of holds the family together. I will be a leader in the family by excuse me. Um, trying to get people together, organizing dinners, organizing vacations. We have a vacation coming up in june and I was the one that organized all of it. I invited everyone, Not, I'm not sure if everybody can go the entire time, but I'm always trying to um, keep people together and especially in my family that I grew up with.

I believe I can be the best candidate for this position because I've had a great experience with managing teams and being in a group. So I'm able to have everyone putting their viewpoint and as well as understand the different characteristics and skills which team has um have vast experience in dealing with multicultural teams as well, and people that have different skill sets from mine. So my leadership skills are trying to accommodate everybody, try to understand me too much to remember. And we also ensure that everybody is included in the team so that their voice can also be heard. Very good organizing and planning and coordinating as well. And I have been able to manage several teams, including just for short term projects or projects. Also been involved in some, you know, teams just for a short period of time. And what I've learned is that every team is different and my understanding the individuals on this team, that's where I can be able to manage the team better and need better as a leader. And so that being in a leadership position doesn't mean that, you know, everything. There will be instances where you also have to learn from your team members and that would help you to become a better leader. I'm very different credit the leader, I want to hear everybody's voice and to be able to know maybe the suggestions the team can bring as well as any input that also helps to be a good leader in terms of how well we manage a team, I would ensure that each individual knows that they are valued and that's something that's important when you're leading a team is to value each individual so that they know that the team is there to succeed if they are there. And if they know that we value them, they're able to give it more input and use their skills to the best of their ability um teems with need encouragement and I feel like constructive criticism is necessary if someone is not doing well, you need to point out firstly that strength point out the fact is that they can improve him and as well as show them the right way or rather give them some tips to improve their behavior so that they can change the way they handled a certain task or perhaps just improved in the way that it was done. And I also feel like emphasizing on a person's strength rather than always looking at their weaknesses also helps in terms of allowing people to do not only see that, you know, they're bad at something that also them to know that they're really good at doing something. It's also been an finances of the different skills also helps and making people aware of their strength and that will certainly help build a team up to encourage everyone so that they have a higher morale in performing and how the morale in in just wanting to be part of a team.

I find that my leadership skills are ways that I've, that it is easy to talk to me about issues that are going on in the team. I have made an open door policy which allows any and all team members who may be below me or equal status to me to come speak to me about their problems without having to resort to hedge or or another means such a ballot box. This will allow team members to easily resolve their issues and a quick and a timely efficient manner. It will also allow openness in communication between myself and team members, which allows me to find out by problems quickly and deal with them before they can turn into other issues. I have also found ways that it is easy to integrate and established, established new rules with new members of the teams who at the moment are becoming more and more popular from other countries. This allows me to know when other team members may need help or new people are having issues such as a language barrier which was an issue with some new team members by doing this, I realized it was a good idea to start english language lessons in our course after work hours, which approve productivity and help with our team relations. Things like this also allowed me to begin team member exercises whether after work, such as going bowling or team dinner or out for drinks. I found that this blur the line a bit between leadership and co workers, which well normally may cause issues, but for me, I find that it is more positive for our team as we become more open with each other, problems become less of an issue. I have also worked my way up to become a leadership position by doing this. I found that I understand my team's wants and needs more so than somebody come in through an interview for position where they may not have previously worked with this group of people by doing this. I know all the problems that my team members had faced because I faced them also with managers, this allows for more communication and I can see where there was problems and I have resolved them when nobody else could before by doing this, there's not, there's not as much issues anymore, we have more productivity were better integrated, we can we spend our days a joint going to work and not not facing dread of when we get there or with somebody going to have an issue, will there be a problem this for me, this doesn't seem to happen. I feel like my leadership skills are very, very personal with my team, I don't see myself as somebody who is above them and should be treated with this great deal of not respect, but there's a great deal of animals like uh this great deal of this should be what's going to happen because I said so I feel like my team members know that they can question my decisions to an extent. If they think that something I've said could actually be done in a better way by doing this. We feel like we're more of a family group than we are a team. And also by doing this, I find out that my team members have these great ideas which would allow me to put them up for promotions and put them up for amazing ways that they can progress in the company. My leadership style is very, very, I want to help people. I want to make my leaderships and my friends my co workers progress as well because it's not just a case of that. I said this, you do that. It's a case of, well, we work together, we are all looking for the best interest in this company. And I would like to think that if I was made into another leadership position, I could bring these skills over as well because it is very important to be on a connected, on a personal level with people that you work with are not just these people that you leave at the end of the day.

Now I understand that this position is a managing position and this is a field that I feel very comfortable in that not only do I feel comfortable in it because I have studied for it, but because I have years of experience, I think the very first job I went to was Assistant manager and its shadowing there where I learned a lot of important skill sets and then for the last two years I have been a manager at my very own business, so I do understand the role and the skills needed. Now a lot of the leadership skills that I have gathered throughout the year have really helped me be able to do my job effectively and efficiently. I think the most important skill is communication not only communication with clients, but communication with employees and the people that work around you, my superior and the people that work under me, I am able to communicate what I want done and when I want done in a friendly but professional, stern tone, start communication, I have that done in under my belt, I can handle that. Secondly, I think time management, not only can I manage my time when I'm working but also be able to to be able to manage other people's time and to keep their scheduling efficient because I believe that if there are proper timetables in place that are also communicated properly that all the work will be done timely and efficiently then also being able to be professional but friendly, so have good relations with your co workers and people under you. So being able to keep a friendly healthy relationship but also one that is authoritative but not too authoritative so that people can respect you and listen to what you need done above all of these reasons. I think I'd be perfect for this job because I am hard working. I am very passionate and I don't allow failure, I don't allow space for failure. If you plan ahead and if you're smart with your time then failure, it doesn't happen so often it's of course failure will always happen. So I am good at problem solving and thinking out of the box. If something unexpected happened, I am able to keep calm and work in a stressful environment. Not only am I able to keep calm, I'm able to calm the people around me and come up with a solution to the problem then I also think to have some type of team building is always very, very, I always implement some type of company. They where you go out and you do company, team building head, getting to know the people that you work with, getting to know their strengths and their weaknesses, help a lot in being able to come together as a team and all be able to work together to the best of everybody's ability, not just yours, not just focusing on how well you do your job, but how you can help others do your job. I think that is very important and I would highly recommend doing team building if I was a manager that in fact I would almost insist on it's very important now about this. I have researched your company and I would be very comfortable with the amount of people that I would be managing. I work very well with other people and I'm a little bit of a people pleaser. So that wouldn't bother me at all. Working with any number of people I could do well in a very big group or even in a smaller group, I can manage both. So these are some of the reasons I have applied for this position and some of the reasons I think I would be perfect for this position, so communication efficiency, time management, team building and just managing whatever amounts of people would be perfect for me. So thank you so much for the time you have taken to listen to these reasons and I hope to be hearing from you soon.

Well growing up, I've always taken that role. I've always been told by other people that they quite enjoy me being their leader, not only because I'm willing to communicate with them, I'm willing to hear out their ideas and I'm very understanding of their situation and their strengths and their weaknesses. Um I'm also extremely stern, I organize my time so that I'm available for everyone else. I'm willing to allow, you know, I help other people organize their time, especially when working on a project and there's certain tasks to do. I learn everyone's individual strengths and weaknesses so that I can target them to go to that a certain project that I think will suit them the most and that will create the most outstanding work that they can create. I think in communication is definitely the biggest thing I think that, you know, being clear in the way that you speak, you know, being just a really good listener, always hearing other people out, not talking over anyone, just being that respectful person who's willing to listen always explaining. And I think what you know, for me that what works for me is kind of a whenever I want an idea out there, I involve them into a story and I get them involved, I think immersing people in a story around the idea allows them to believe that it's all of our ideas and we all come collectively to kind of understand what I'm trying to say, I think, you know, getting them evolved, maybe having a bit of humor in there, but making sure that I'm completely clear and that I'm friendly enough so that they know that they can always talk to me. I think being super organized is a really key aspect being a leader because when you can't organize your own time, you can't organize other people's time and you can't be there for them. I think that's probably the most important thing. I think, you know, being being there for everyone just being that person that they can go to and if they can get the right answers for is really important. Another thing is being motivational. I know sometimes people can struggle with that being motivated and I think being a person who's optimistic, friendly and just you know, always knowing what to say. I think I can be that person, I'm very convincing, I'm very convincing and making them believe that they can do things even if they think that they can't, I'm always there to motivate them. I think another thing in terms of the motivation is that when someone does something good is that you give them a reward, you thank them, you let it known that they're doing something great. I think that is super key in building a team, I think especially when it comes down to the responsibilities of a leader that is definitely a very important thing. I think just thanking everyone, you know, and you know, just letting them be heard in when they, when they are doing something good, I think another thing is setting very effective goals. I think if they have, you know, set goals and they understand and being clear and just understanding the set goals means that they know what they're working towards, when people don't know what they're working towards and they're confused and then they also don't have anyone to talk to. Things can tumble out place, they can get really unmotivated and I found this with a lot of people when I, whenever I've led a class, I think that's always been something that they've been scared of, whether they're anxious and again that comes into listening to their situation if they're more anxious, I try and bring them in, I keep up with them, I talked to them a lot more if they, especially if they find it hard to talk to other people, I'm always the one to come to them and always being super friendly and super understanding and just helping whenever I can, I think every person has different situations and it's just being understanding of that, I think you have to have a lot of trust in your team and when you put that trust there, they trust you to lead them and I think that is very important as well, I think a lot of these are important, but you know obviously it all comes down to the team and it's just whether you know how you can control that environment, just time management, making sure that you have the time, making sure that you have the time to train them correctly and just identifying any problems and always being there prioritizing tasks. All of that comes under leadership and it's just being about positive and just a happy and caring person, you know, you're empathetic, you're friendly, you're always willing to help others just having a bit of humor, you know, and being, you know, all that positive reinforcement, everything just creates a great place for people to work in. And that's what I think I have. I think being trustworthy, confident and just being an available person is probably the biggest thing about being a leader. And I think that's why I'm a pretty good leader because I am always there to make time for everyone else.",POSITIVE,0.5356,0.0042,0.4595,0.0007,908.0,LOW,6,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),19.22,1,0,0,"Some college, no degree",Female,8.839117,8.562095,8.443579

I feel I would be an excellent candidate for this role because I have lots of transferable skills from my previous work experience. I've worked with the same company for 22 years, so I recognize the importance of loyalty and dedication. I'm an excellent team player and at the moment in my current role I lead a small team of about eight people where I lead by example, a model tasks that I expect my team to do have excellent listening skills, so I make sure I'm well aware of all the issues that my employees have going on in their private lives and I make time to support them with this. I have, I recognize the importance of constructive criticism but also sharing positivity within my team. So positive feedback is shared as well as negative criticisms. There are negative criticisms, I will bring them up within the team to make sure that we can work on them together and people are aware of what we need to do. I would communicate the needs of the company really, really well, so I would make sure my team are aware of what I'm being asked from higher up, so that's a shared message that gets through to all of us. I would lead by example, I would take on all the tasks and model what I expect of my team and punctual, I'm loyal and reliable. I put the needs and reputations of the company at the forefront of all I do um and that's particularly evident in my current role where as I say I've worked there for 22 years and I've been a loyal member of the staff and I have a really good understanding of what's expected of me. I think that management position needs somebody who is prepared to work hard, put in extra hours if necessary. Which is another thing that I've done within my current role where I'm working at the moment. So for example recently where we've been expecting off stead into our establishment I've put extra hours in um done overtime, worked within my team and should that everybody within the team knows what's expected of them for that role. So I think that's a good example of my leadership qualities. Um a good example where I've led my team into success. I'd be very willing um to come and work for your company and to get to know the team that I would be working with their. I think that I have excellent personable skills, my current role. I communicate a lot with parents as well as my peers and employees. Um And that's really important part of my role, making sure that parents get the message and that parent partnership um comes across really importantly um So that we're all part of the same community and I think that transfers over to whatever business whether it's education or a different business. I think that partnership is key. Um I have a good understanding of I. T. Skills which I use in my current role. The planning for delivering lessons when we have blended learning. So I think those I. T. Skills could be particular helpful especially in current curve in times where we may have to use teams for meetings um or zoom for meetings and well experienced in all of that and I think it's an excellent way to bring the team together. Um And generate positivity be more time productive. So I could see that being a really really useful skill that I could bring over as well. Um And actually I did some training based on that in my previous role um To up skill myself um to meet the current demands of the new working experiences. Um Whilst working from home. Um And I was able to showcase these skills across the whole academy as well which was very much appreciated. Um And commented on positively uh the people I work with at the moment would say that I am a good communicator and I work hard as part of the team. I'm willing to roll my sleeves up and get stuck in myself. I want to ask the people to do things that I don't I'm not willing to do myself. So all of the tasks within the setting I will take on. Um and lead by example. So I think that's really important that people see that you're willing to do that in my current role. I worked with staff to create a shared vision and ethos so that everybody felt that their views and their values were taken into account, and then we wrote that up together. So we all had a shared ownership of what was expected of us a chair, weekly meetings in my current role, keeping minutes of those, making sure that all staff are informed the new initiatives, any problems that we might be having within the setting. Because I think that key communication really helps to keep everybody in the loop and makes everybody responsible for the things uh, that are going on within the company.

So I had a direct reporting line to senior management. Aside from this, I've been in my current role for about eight months and I feel that I've learned that the role very quickly and I have been able to um basically, well I've shown leadership abilities because various members of staff have come to me for a device, especially when the team leader is away.

All the individuals were pretty much older than I was. So it was a little intimidating. Two lead staff and faculty, some of which I actually saw around campus As a 20 year old at the time. But some of the skills that I think really helped me where my communication, my passion for the subject because I am a nutrition major and my love of seeing these people grow over time and have setbacks but learn to communicate through those setbacks and ask me questions and learn from those Overall. After the end of the six months, My cohort of 13 individuals lost a total of Â£130, so right around Â£10 a person. And our goal was for Each individual to lose 5-7% of their body fat in order to meet the CDC recommended guidelines of lowering the risk for diabetes And for developing type two diabetes when covid hit, it was a little bit difficult to maintain that leadership position because we were in person each week. Leading a meeting with a new topic, so exercise, sleep, stress, food, grocery shopping, so on and we had a lot of things planned like doing a grocery store tour where we're going to take our cohort and show them what to look for in a grocery store, how not to get too overwhelmed, maybe not necessarily what not to buy because no food is a bad food, but how to help prevent getting unnecessary items or things that might trigger cravings that you are trying to avoid. But so with Covid, we ended up going all online and we started an online forum to actually help maintain that group aspect since everyone's kind of schedules and needs change as the pandemic carry it on eventually in the end, everyone still maintained great progress in their lifestyle changed. It was incredible to see he kind of was able to adapt a little bit with Covid. My other leadership positions do include running cross country and leading the younger runners through why we're doing this to put in the hard work and to see the outcome since we were a nationally ranked cross country program, which was awesome, but not as impactful as my internship as with the diabetes prevention program. My final leadership that I can really touch on is Nanning and tutoring and babysitting. I have nanny for many years now throughout college and I love being able to lead a group of kids last year I now need up to seven kids at once, all different ages, so it's great to see the growth Um, throughout the year I was with them, so from ages 3-12, so it was a big range of personality changing, needs changing, once changing, and I love being a part of that and I know I've been an impact on their life since I still talk to some of the kids today, um and them on mine and then currently nanny again, some young kids and I was just again, watching them grow, teaching them discipline what to do and what not to do and how to behave properly and leading them through kind of the challenges of life and with Covid and everything that's going on right now.",POSITIVE,0.7549,0.0747,0.0421,0.1282,633.0,MED,7,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),8.990001,1,0,0,"Bachelor's degree (e.g. BA, BS)",Female,8.740805,8.466725,7.968957

Like I'd rather help them than than let them just like suffer in silence. Like I don't think that's a very, very healthy way of doing things and if they ever need help with like a certain part of their work or job, I would be more than happy to just help them because it's better than just leaving them in they do. So they have so much stuff to like do and with no one to be there for them. And I think with I think I'm quite a team player, like I'd rather see the whole group like go up rather than myself. Like I wouldn't like it. If only I like so say if I was doing some something for my own benefit, I'd rather do it for the team's benefit rather than in mind because it would make me feel quite selfish and I wouldn't feel really good about that. Um I am quite humble like when it comes to having a lead leadership role because I know some people the power gets to their heads and then they just act really weird. Like um like the power trip a lot and I don't think that's some that's some something I can do because that would, that would have made me feel like a good leader in my opinion. Um I have quite like, so my coming here being communications, well they're quite good, like if I don't like assume then um I wouldn't tell that person in a blunt and rude way. I'd rather like, I'd rather tell them them in a way that they'd understand. So then they know how to like improve rather than just pushing them down and making them feel bad about soon something and build my abilities like in like a work team is that I am quiet determined when I set in my mind and what I want to do, like I am not ceaseless lacquer at all. Like slacking is probably the thing that I have never done. Like I, I am always determined to get my own why worked onto a Sarah tran standard that people find good and I am very hard working like, so like I said, I don't slack, like I am quite hard working and I'm organized with my work. Like I'd rather have like a routine schedule thing rather than just just leaving it all to the last minute because I don't think that's like that sets a good, a good example to the people around you. Like not being organized means that you the one you'd have a routine and secondly that um yes, that you can't do stuff as well as you would if you did have a routine.

My name is my hair con, and I believe that I would be the best candidate for this management position because of the various leadership skills that I have and I have shown these skills to the various leadership positions that I have previously held. So, um, some of the leadership positions that I have held in the past, um, include the logistics manager of an organization called the Power Woman Society at the University of Houston. And so I was an officer of this organization, and with that I had to basically, um, lead all of the other officers and make sure that the logistics of every single event that we held with, um perfect. I also was in charge of welcoming all the new members and just kind of telling them how to join and also what we do in our organization. So that did require a lot of leadership skills as, and I had to lead my officer team as well, and I worked very closely with the president of our organization to make sure that everything ran smooth thing. Another great leadership position that I recently held this past semester is being a CRM team leader for a sales organization that I'm a part of at the University of Houston. So this organization is actually the nation's leading sales program, called the Program for Excellence and Selling. And so with this, we do have new students coming in, And it can be a little hard for the new students because there is a live quota, real money, and they have to reach out to, you know, top executives at companies and a lot of these students have not done that before. So as a team leader, I get a group of about 5-6 new students, and with that I meet up with them once a week. I helped them to the process. Um, if they ever you need any help or have any questions, I'm the first person to answer it. And so I have to, you know, lead them through that and ensure that they all hit quota and you have the best experience possible in our program. And so that was another really awesome experience that I had, which was being a CRM team leader, and another great experience I've had was actually at my past job, so I worked as a group team leader at the Fort Bend County School Ship Elementary. And so with that, I was in charge of Multiple students about 4060 at a time. And so with this, I had to basically come up with curriculum and ensure that all of our students followed all of the curriculum. We were on schedule on time, and it wasn't after school program. And so all these students, you know, sometimes they had a bad day or sometimes, you know, they had a really long day. They're tired, so I would have to ensure that we're all on track. There's no problems, no fights. And, um, students age group that I lived with with sometimes kindergarteners first graders, um, all the way up to fifth graders. And so there were all these different age groups. Um, I had to kind of change the way I spoke to every single group because there are different students and they do understand that different levels, depending on their age. And I was also actually in charge of the art club at that school as well, where I came up with the curriculum in made sure all the students were having fun and we're able to learn, and every student has a different learning style. So I have to also ensure that the way I taught worked for every single student. And so they were also at the school. There were sometimes fights, and, um, at one point I actually had to separate 1/4 benefit skater from getting into a fight, and I had to display my leadership skills and get the other. There was two new employees that were with me, and it was just us three because it was early in the morning shift. And so I had to explain my leadership qualities and ensure that the other employees knew what to do. I gave them tasks. I diffused to fight, and I reported back to my supervisors and made sure that everything was handled and that those students their parents were talked to and everything. So I went through the process, and I made sure that and all the other employees that were in the room as well um knew what to do.

I believe that I am the best person for this managing position because I have lots of many leadership skills and abilities. I believe that my leadership skills started when I was actually a little girl in school, I would always try and be persevering in anything, any task that I did. So I would always try and get it right if I got it wrong, I had to research and find out how to get it right and I would always persevere and that is one of the most important skills to have as a leader, perseverance, never giving up and that is one of the skills and qualities that I have. I believe that if there is something that I'm unsure about, I need to to get it 100% if it means me asking another person, if it means me researching, I have to get it right. So perseverance is one of the best skills that I have that will promote me and will make me a better manager. The second skill that I have is setting goals and attaining it. I believe that in life we should set goals, we should work towards those goals and we should excel at achieving those goals. It is very important that setting goals and achieving them, it makes you feel better and it motivates you to go that much further. Another one of my best men leadership skills that I have is that I am trustworthy and I believe that people have always come to me asking for my opinion on matters and also giving me a lot of their personal details and information because they believe that I am trustworthy. Being a leader means that when one of your team members disclose information to you, they should trust you that you will not then take that information and and leak it out or share it with other people. So being trustworthy is also a very important skill which I believe that I possess. I believe in being trustworthy as well as being confidential. Also about work, work related matters, confidentiality is extremely important and you don't want to share your secrets about your company and your staff with other staff. So confidentiality is another skill that I have. There are so many other leadership skills and abilities that I have, like for example, you know, listening skills, I believe that we should listen and comprehend we should not just not our head when we have a team member speaking to us, but listening is very important because sometimes when you listen, you are able to solve a problem just by listening, because people will inform you about the problem. But if you are too busy and your mind is too involved with other matters, you might miss it. So listening skills are very important. Other leadership skills that I have is that I'm a role model. I believe in setting an example a good example and by living up to the values. Um, and the beliefs of the company, thereby promoting the company and also motivating staff, um other abilities that I have are that is that I'm dedicated to my job if it means that I have to work after hours or weekends in order to get tasks done and to ensure that the team is running smoothly, dedication is one of the other skills that I have. And lastly the last skill that I believe that I have to be a leader is the fact that I, I have experience behind me and whatever experience I have gained over the years throughout my career, just build me as a better manager to promote my team, to promote the company, to make a profit for the company and to fly the flag high for the company. So being a leader and having leadership qualities and skills our utmost importance in ensuring my success, the success of the company, the success of my team members beneath me, as well as other stakeholders within the company.

I am a law student at the Edinburgh Law School and I am currently my fourth year of my scott's elope program. I am applying to become a manager of this company because it is where my passions lie and my career ambitions lie here. And I think I have developed the necessary transferable skills that are necessary to become a successful manager. And I think it really started off with my experience in high school where I was the president of the honor committee for two years and the honor committee really was a student led committee that design curriculums that's revolved around ethical learning as well as following the school values. And I was really in charge for those two years of delegating tasks, time management, as well as setting up deadlines for our campaigns and our classes and organizing those classes between, during our free time between classes and between our regular classes and following that, when I graduated, I joined university and a lot of university societies and after my first year I sought out a few committee rules, one of them being the secretary secretary role for the Edinburgh Tony student Society, where I was in charge of organizing events as well as delegating tasks to um to my fellow committee members and volunteers. So one example of a large scale event that I was um, primarily in charge of was the food fair, where I helped sort of design the menu and Figure out who should be cooking what meal and what performances should be held during that event and we sold about 200 tickets. It was a very successful event and I felt that my skills really were helpful in leading us to the goal, of you know profits and as well as promoting charity, societies. um culture and furthermore. During this year I have um become the sponsorship director of the Commercial law Society, where I am able to sort of gauge where my teammates are in the process of their um pursuing their legal careers and what I do is I negotiate with law firms um regarding our sponsorship contracts. So in return for our sponsors giving us a fixed fee, we will promote the graduate opportunities to our committee to our society members and I found that this negotiation process and networking process with various law firms allowed me to become more comfortable with talking to clients as well as networking with people in order to provide more opportunities for myself. And I find that it is quite crucial to have this skill as a manager because you're constantly having to deal with clients as well as your own teammates, you know, to be able to work towards a common goal. And I find that that is, you know, that is something I am really passionate about and really skill that because of my experience experiences and I think that this position will be perfect for me and if you do want to know anything more about my CV, please contact me and I will be happy to elaborate on any of my experiences and any of my attributes.

So I have tried to adapt my approach to dealing with different people in different ways, so um that could be in terms of working with someone who say works in a lab and needs more technical assistance to a manager who might need more support um organizing their day or organizing staff, I think um when it comes to leadership you do need to be flexible and I try to do that in my everyday position. Um I think my experience suits me to this position because I can apply it in in different ways. Um I can give an example of uh someone who didn't quite understand a procedure that we were doing and constantly came up with results that weren't quite correct. So um I sat with her and we went through what's the standard operating procedure said, um and it turned out that there was a step that she had skipped, not because she missed it, but she she didn't think it applied in this protocol. Um So we actually sat and did it together and that gave her the confidence to to know how to go through it properly and obviously not to skip that step. Um So when I'm approaching things like training, um I kind of go through for the three times rules, so the first time I show you the second time you do it while I watch, and the third time I let you do it while I'm a little bit further away, um and that way it gives you a bit more confidence to, to carry on um and do things by yourself and ask the questions that you need and take the notes. Um whereas if it comes to someone in a more sort of administrative role, you might not need to do it that way. You might need to um simply just send them a document and some people like to be a bit more autonomous, so you want to work with them um and let them do things their way. Um so I think it, I think leadership comes in many forms and I think the good leaders know that and that you need to approach things from different angles um having worked in many different industries, um that also helps because you find certain industries require a different type of, of leadership. So, for example, if you're working in a corporate, um it might be more about portraying the corporate image and making sure that everything that is done according to how it is laid down from um the headquarters, whereas if you're working in academia, it might be to help someone um works through, say, their research or their PhD uh in a better way. So that could be more of a supportive role as opposed to a leadership role in a sense. Um so it really does depend on how you approach the person as to what you can get out of them. I think most people are willing to learn and grow if they have the right leader, and it's just finding that right leader who will um support as opposed to uh impose they will on someone. Um So yeah, I think that's that's about how I would approach developing leadership skills.

Um I want to take some time to introduce you to myself and what I do within the business as you may or may not be aware, I'm fairly new to this industry. I've only been here for a year, but in that time I've been able to bring a lot of the skills and assets from other previous roles that have had to this job and it's been next to more successful as you may or may not have heard. So currently oversee about four of our colleagues in the Philippines and I'm their first point of contact and we usually do that via email and teams messaging and video calling and it's been really successful. I think that they didn't feel supported in their roles previously and felt that a lot of things have been safeguarded away from them. So what have really worked to do rather than focusing on with the tiny minuti of the role is really worked to improve their confidence and improve their relationship with the business and with myself and give them more ownership over their own role rather than them being dictated to. I'm aware of the fact that outsourcing is a must these days it's very, very expensive to recruit in the UK and sometimes we're not getting the caliber of staff that we want from external providers, so it's really important that when we do have good staff and then that we retain them. Um so I think that my relationship building with them has been great, We've noticed less churn with within recruitment, so that's good. I'll take that as a positive and are your end one to ones were all very positive, seem to be looking forward to the new tasks ahead and potentially furthering their careers with us, which is exciting for both them and us. And really that is the men part of my role within this business. I think that people should always come first and everything else will follow. Obviously we're money centric, we want the cash to come in and we need it in order to maintain everything and keep her staff, but unless you've got your staff on board, that's just not going to work. And I feel that we've really managed to cross um a bridge in relations to that, especially with the difficulties with the pandemic and the layoffs and bit of job uncertainty. I think that we've managed to solidify um and really motivate and create an optimism about the years ahead and what it might hold um for our staff for me, that gives me great job satisfaction and my facilitator and I love to a little bit hate for people to come in and hate working for me. So I'm motivated primarily by keeping people happy. That said, we've had a couple of things within the last year that has been quite difficult to deal with um with regards to health issues and feeling isolated with the pandemic. Um but again, through being people orientated that's been dealt with in a successful way and in a way that has not home the business. So what I would propose to you is that we're going to take this this job boom, which you've advertised for. And yes, there's technical aspects to it and there's a lot of business knowledge which I can work on, but I really want to focus on the management, people, management aspect of it. Once we get that sorted, everything else will fall into place and have a proven track record with this business that that's something that I'm capable of. And as you'll be aware of, my your interviews have been very, very positive and I believe I have a good reputation within the business.

So with you know dance I was practicing, I would have my mom take me to the gyms every weekend and I would practice Outside of you know, already the 4-5 days we were doing as a team. Um So I was leading not only in the fact that I had leadership roles but also by example. Um and then one of my proudest achievements was graduating valedictorian from my high school class out of close to 400 kids and um you know, I think that again shows the self motivation I have and the fact that even if I wasn't directly leading people, I tried to do as much as I could by example. Um and then I would also host like a bunch of study nights, my friends in high school um just because I wanted to hang out with people and also help them out with studying and so I think that against shows that I was willing to help others um and as a leader get down with my peers and do the same things with them and then in college I got into my dream college and I continued dancing and I was a safety officer there. Um and then I also found in my own club about autism awareness and so I had to, you know, it shows that I continue taking initiative in college and it wasn't even just you know like inheriting a leadership role, like I had to build it from the ground up, I had to go in front of the student government and you know defend why we should be officially sanctioned by the university, I had to write the constitution from scratch, right the officer applications and then choose officers. Um all while still being a college student. And then my biggest thing was ROTC, so I did that in college to to pay for college and so you know, that was a huge time crunch on top of everything else and I was waking up at six a.m. Or I had to go to work out to six a.m. Um and then my dance practice wasn't until close to 10, so I wasn't even starting clap or starting homework until I got home. I was overloading every semester. Um but I learned a lot of self discipline and you know, I did struggle at the beginning, but I showed that I kept pushing and kept pushing um to achieve my dreams of, you know, wanting to still dance but also learning how to be a leader in the military, which was something I wasn't expecting. Um and one of my biggest experiences was before, before commission, you have to go to a camp and um, it's close, it's over a month And you know, you're spending weeks out in the woods and running these like missions and everyone's under stress, you're sleeping like five hours a night and even then you're getting wakened up in the middle to do your 30 minutes of being on guard for your platoon and everyone's stressed out. And so it's showing that, you know, it can be easy to be a leader whenever you're in a really controlled environment, but when you're out in the woods, you haven't had any, any hot meals, you know, you're limited on water, even Working with Â£30 on your back for miles at a time. It's kind, it can be hard to be a leader in that situation, you know, and you can't even just yell at everyone, You have to be, you have to motivate your other appears to. And so um, one of my evaluations was, was based on the fact that he never saw me without a good attitude and without a smile on my face even though things could be really hard out there. Um, and then I ended up commissioning, which is a really great achievement of mine. And um, I also ended up getting into medical school, which is what I'm doing now and since then I've been a mentor to first year students, I was chosen in a program to be kind of like a camp counselor for orientation, but I talked with him every week um about how to succeed in school, and then I was a member of a committee planning. Um so the orientation for the first year and I was just planning service sites and one of the chairs ended up reaching out to me was like, I would think it would be Um one of the Great potential member of one of the two main chairs. Um So I applied and I ended up getting it, and so now I get to work with the deans and I plan all the curriculum for the orientation for first years, um which is really exciting to me because the cause and what we teach them are things that I'm really passionate about, and so those are just kind of examples of things that I've done to show my leadership and to show that I keep um taking initiative and have the drive for things that I'm really passionate about.",POSITIVE,0.5671,0.0117,0.4178,0.0034,939.0,MED,8,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),13.28,1,0,0,"Bachelor's degree (e.g. BA, BS)",Female,8.644806,8.371532,9.483033

So as you know, I currently manage a team of 12 subordinates And I'm really happy to say um that this year I've been able to develop 50% of the team, so we've had um some of the team go to other markets um and take on additional roles within the company. Um Some of these positions, I have actually taken the Korea, the initiative to actually create some of these positions didn't exist a year ago.

You know, my team feel that they can trust me, but likewise, I trust my team to be able to make decisions without me having to micromanage them. Um And lastly, when it comes to leadership, another strength that I feel um I have um is really I'm someone who can communicate in an inspiring way, I can get people on board with an idea, even if sometimes that idea is quite unpopular. I feel that that's reflected by um, in the last employee of the year, um I was nominated as one of the top three colleagues um in our office.

Um, I feel that this is another strength of mine um, in terms of my abilities while I feel I would be suited for this management role is um I'm someone who is creative and entrepreneurial, so one thing that I launched this year was a new benefits platform for the company, um It was something that was very well received and as a result of that we've seen over 30% uptake in the company benefits throughout the organization, which I'm really, really happy about and this was something that we've, we've never done before. Um I feel that I'm good at getting people on board um in the current role that I have, it's important to be influential to be able to really get people to even when they have that sort of diversity of thoughts and opinions, um, to really be able to clearly communicate the company vision and to get people really excited about that and to be on board.

Um So those rare things are covered and I understand about from high performing teams And the Lancia model, you know, five description of the team and it's really about in terms of how I lied and my style, it's about well initially having the trust to be team, you know, if you don't have trust, I don't think you can really lead them, you know, you need to be a trust them, but it's really critical that they trust you, I think being out to give honest feedback and um that's absolutely critical. That's both constructive feedback and we're also praised as well, where it's g you know, people thrive on that. I'm really just creating an environment where everyone can work really well. And I think the way of doing that is being understanding the people, you're leading, understanding the team, how they take, what's their personality style. Um I'm really listening to them, you know, somebody once said to me that you have two ears and one mouth and you should use them in that proportion. I've always taken that for like, you know, just really good advice because it's so important to listen to people to really understand what's going on and have empathy as well because if you're listening, um then you know, you can leave people because you know, what is it they need, what they're asking for you, for you from you as a leader because that's absolutely key. And it's also about how, you know, how do I am at myself, you know, am I arriving on time? Am I completely my deadlines? Am I if I make a promise to anybody, do I fulfill that promise in the required time scale? Because that's like I said already said about having that trust is really absolutely critical in terms of the management that ISIS I worked in a supply chain team. Um, so you know, particularly the last few years that's been really challenging. We covid with, you know, shortages, you know, there's also a global crisis in supply chain with particularly, you know, and in the UK um, transport issues. So it's been a really stressful time and you know, not only at work, but obviously at home with covid and you know, I think as a leader, the way I felt it was important to lead the team that was managing was, you know, to be really aware of what's going on in their life as well, not just at work, but at home and again, in terms of my leadership, start, all it is about, you know, the people needing, getting to know them really well, not just from work point of view, but like I said, you know, what's our relationship, what's the home life like they got Children and you know, and I'm just asking them, you know, just checking in well, how are you, how are you doing? I think that's one of the key questions, particularly with remote working and you know, and I think that was one of the reasons why I was, you know, selected to go on the senior leadership team because that was something that I was known for. Um my previous work was people leadership, because I've spent time with people, you know, I wouldn't just be doing my job. I'd see it's equally important, you know, when you're on that leadership leadership position to spend that time and make sure you do also have time to commit your own work commitments, but to have them sweet just to spend that time with the team and I really know what's going on, so that's what I would bring to this and that's what I bring to the job and why I think you should employ me.

Um So I'm just gonna be talking a bit about my leadership qualities and why I think that I would be the best candidate suitable for this position of manager. So I'd say that in the past my experience has mostly been subordinate roles. I haven't yet had a proper manager position, but I think I've demonstrated some pretty good skills and I'm really hungry for the opportunity um to get more experience in a managerial position and take on that leadership. Um So I'm going to talk a little bit about some of my lead, some of the ways which I'll demonstrate leadership skills. So for example, I've recently taking been taking in my own time, I volunteered at some workshops and and I've been doing some courses outside of my job in order to improve leadership skills. I've done that for a few a few years now um and these courses really helped to um harbor those skills in leadership and responsibility. For example, I am one of the courses I opted to, I initiated organizing a gala for my college that I was part of um in the part time job and I managed to yes, successfully secure this venue and a band also truly used to be. So that shows some leadership and so I have to take responsibility of that, I oversaw a team and manage them. So even though that wasn't a an official manager position, I became a team leader in that example, so I think that demonstrates the fact that not only can I manage a team, but I can also take on that responsibility and I thrive under that responsibility, I feel. I also oversaw recently in one of the workshops, I had to oversee four other students uh for a raffle prize in a local business. Um and the event was a huge success. We raised over Â£400 for our charity of choice. So again, I really not only do, I think I excel in a leadership position, but I think that it also improves me as a person because when I started it obviously I was quite nervous as for apprehensive, but I really think that in recent times these external workshops and courses, voluntary things that I've done have really helped me um grow as a person and I'm now a lot more confident in my leadership abilities. Um I'd say that my leadership qualities are probably best described as dedicated motivating and I have a big attention to detail. Um For instance, I currently oversee a small group of uh colleagues in my workplace, which I started at part time and yeah, I've now got a not a proper managerial role, bucks. A I basically run that small team once a week where we discuss people's interests and um ambitions within the company in order to help it succeed. Um And that was something which I initially volunteered for. Um and then it's now become an official role within that company. Um and I basically, the way that I like to run my team is I think it's really important to recognize my colleagues small winds. Um, does it really motivates people to do better. So those are just a few examples of some of the ways in which I've voluntary and now full time shown uh, kind of leadership qualities and ways in which I thrive on being a leader, which I would like to do more full time now in this manager position.

Um to the point where the employees are competent enough to in the software that they can handle using it with customers unsupervised and I could then delegate tasks to them involving this software because that is another great leadership quality I have in knowing when to delegate tasks so that my own work is not overwhelmed and I can focus on the things that need my specific attention without getting distracted by smaller tasks that could be done by other employees. My previous jobs were quite hands on in terms of front of house work and I thrived in taking a leadership role when patrons arrived. Um I delegated and explained important tasks not only to co workers, but also the abundance of volunteers that come to the theater. I would then take charge of the room at large in terms of uh pointing patrons in the right direction and making sure that all patrons are safe and comfortable in the building and able to watch the performance in a timely manner. Um, in this way I was leader not only of my own team, but also the theater at large, making sure that everything was running on schedule and communications with other teams was also doing its best were, it was phrased poorly, but ensuring that all conversations and communications with other teams was done on time and clearly as communication within the theater is um integral to make sure that all pieces of the theater machine are working together. Um, and I always ensured that I was communicating in the moment with stage management either in person or over walkie talkie, but always also in constant communication via email um with anyone else who might need to be apprised of any situations in the theater. Um, I also make an excellent leader because I'm very good at dealing with employee errors. When the folks that I directly supervise make a mistake, I'm always very patient with them, I walk them through the mistake and where to point out where things went wrong before I walk them through how to fix it or just how to do better in the future if we can't fix it in that moment. I have always made myself very approachable, so employees can ask me questions or advice on how to improve. Um, I can think of a number of examples, um, maybe not where something went wrong, but where I've had to explain like, hey, here is a better way to deal with what just happened and my employees have always been quite grateful for this information. Um I am a great leader because I am sure that the workplace is welcoming to all employees and that no employee feels uncomfortable or unprepared. Because I think one of the worst parts, one of the worst feelings you can have as an employee is feeling like you don't have the um tasks or the skills or the information to do your job properly because everyone wants to do their job properly. So I always ensure that all of my employees feel like they have access to information or skills or what they need to do their jobs properly into the best of their abilities.

When I say below me, I do not mean I am better than than them, but I'm referring to ranks. What I do is I let people in the company express their opinions.

My name is Kathy. I would like to interview for the position of HR manager at X. Y. Z. Company limited. I have previously been a h. r. consultant and the HR manager for over 20 years are all working in the private sector. I have had both as leadership roles and I think I could bring a lot to the position of HR manager as advertised. So firstly to tell you a little bit about myself, I studied a business degree at the University of Central Lancashire and then did a diploma in industrial relations and I had a first job as a trainee consultant in an industrial relations advisory company. I was quickly promoted to the position of managing consultants and I supervised a team of consultants who went out and did HR jobs for employers throughout the country. It was a national business and as part of that troll I would recruit consultants and induct them into the company procedures. And a lot of my role was to train them as the standard of employment law was insufficient. So I also then went on to do their training in different employment law skills and also how to be a good HR consultant and to have the same level of skills. I think I showed a high degree of leadership there. I had a self employed, a team of consultants in some of the areas of the country and had 46 hR consultants working directly for me in house as well. Uh We ran a 24 hour telephone advisory service and contract of employment drafting service for employers nationally. So my job was to make sure that all of those jobs were done on time and to a sufficient standard part of that role in also involved taking the lead on any client complaints. So where one of my HL consultants perhaps have got something a little bit wrong or had failed to deliver a good service in time, My role was to go out to see them and to correct the mistakes made and to make sure that the future the client was happy and renewed their contact with us. Also, I was responsible for employee appraisals and motivation of staff, which sometimes there wasn't a lot of promotion opportunities within the company, so it was more a case of making sure they had a good job satisfaction and encourage them to move to different skills and to make sure they were multi skills to keep their level of job satisfaction high. In addition, I was responsible for discipline of those staff. Um so if we had problems with absenteeism Or problems with conduct, which I have to say wasn't wasn't too frequent in the 250 staff that I was responsible for. It was more a question of perhaps dealing with health issues and taking a proactive role in ensuring that any of those problems were sorted out to both the interest of the employee and the company and I really enjoyed that role. I think the best thing I enjoyed about my leadership role was the motivational side, I think, and the challenge of making sure everyone was trained properly. I also enjoyed the fact that staff used to communicate well with me. So I think hopefully that reflected my leadership style of communication. I think I am an open communicator and I'm a fair leader. I and I think my staff recognized that in me that I would not be concerned with what had gone wrong with more how to put the problem right? And my staff often gave me feedback that they were grateful for that attitude. And also my clients were grateful to that any problems were quickly sorted out. So it wasn't a case of what have you done wrong, but how can we make sure it's right and try and not to have that same problem in the future? So I think it's all to do with the fact that I had a good trainer. And I hope that that training has made me a good leader and the adage that don't necessarily expect people to do",NEUTRAL,0.1366,0.0078,0.8554,0.0002,697.0,MED,9,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),9.82,1,0,0,"Bachelor's degree (e.g. BA, BS)",Female,10.23109,9.94238,9.843217

I have a strict time schedule so I will always be able to fit in organizing everybody around else around my own commitments. Um Uh huh. I have go to confidence skills and very good at public speaking so I'll be able to um speaking regular like weekly staff meetings and hold all of these to account and be able to eloquently get my point across. Um I think I would also be very good at resolving conflict.

So, you know, I believe that leadership and management can be two different things. Um so for me, effective leadership is essentially being able to lead from the front, so what I mean by that is I'm willing to do what I'm asking my team to do obviously in certain circumstances that's not going to be necessary and potentially not possible, but the fact is is unwilling to get stuck in, so I'm not asking them to do something that I myself would never do and I think that's quite important. I'm also one of the biggest attributes that I believe in form good leadership and I believe I've demonstrated over the years is flexibility. So, you know, as we know, we're currently in in the midst of a global pandemic and what that's meant is changes to people's personal lives, changes to business structures and just a change in need of business demand and being able to again lead from the front to be flexible in in meeting those changes, flexible in being able to support individuals in the team with different working patterns with different ways of doing things and also to support free, quite a challenging time and being flexible to flex sample, flex down to change business needs to essentially And see the business and also to support the team that I'm driving forward, you know, I'm very committed to to to improvement, to drive and change to lasting results, so not just doing things in the moment, but having a 44 for the future and lasting results basically that will come as a result of that. Um I think also one of the biggest things for me is being qualified strength coach. So essentially the ability to draw out and identify individual strengths and giving them tasks and responsibilities that basically work in line with those strengths, I think that's really, really important. So a team that plays to their strengths. Individual players that play to their strengths I believe make an effective team. So that's something I'm really, really passionate about. You know, not just having a bunch of people doing random tasks and random jobs that they're unfulfilled and unsatisfied in, but finding out actually what are you good at, what are you strong at? And so what task will see that strength play to the best of your ability? So I'll get the best out of you, but also you will get the best out of the work. So I think that's something that's really important for management and leadership. Being able to identify that, being able to identify how the team will work together. So I'm quite big on engagement, team engagement, team collaboration. Um I think that a good leader is somebody who is able to bring together a group of people who may not have otherwise known each other in a work setting and basically put them in a place or create an environment where they can get the best out of the team. So putting in line or putting together principles Team E force you know so everybody knows sort of clear roles and responsibilities who's responsible for what who's doing what who to go to for what where to go for help putting in place a body system if their new new starters that kind of thing. So just creating a team atmosphere I'm very organized and I like the use of to do list traditional to do lists but also um some excel type I guess organizational tools like a gang shop I'm really keen on things like that just to keep me on track with my workload keep me ahead of what I should be doing and I find that that has helped me to work very efficiently and proficiently. So it really helped me to get the best out of myself so that I can give my best to the people that I'm leading and I think yeah also in terms of leadership skills and attributes I would say is being able. So I think that the strength kind of covers a lot of things because you know in a team you're always gonna have different competencies, different likes different dislikes. So again just using strategies like strength finding too I guess encouraged the weaker members of the team but also know how to continue to support the stronger members of the team and finding things that people are not good at and looking at. Okay, where is the stretch? You know, what, what challenges or opportunities are there that will help individual stretch in areas where there's maybe hidden potential things that they can do, what they don't know they could do and actually what's what's just hit in a week, that's what's hit in an area that actually they don't want to grow in, but maybe that's the majority of their work and so it's not as productive. So I think for me, those are the key things for a great leader and why I would be suitable for the job.",POSITIVE,0.7494,0.0147,0.1986,0.0373,876.0,LOW,4,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),16.92,1,0,0,"Bachelor's degree (e.g. BA, BS)",Female,8.971821,8.693684,8.572779

Um I believe in having people who are qualified to do certain jobs and then trusting them with those jobs and creating environment where if they feel um they have questions that they can come and ask um versus being micromanaged all the time and feeling like they're under a microscope. Um also kind of a more like to create more of a team environment where everybody's working together and um to accomplish the goal and um where everybody's work is important and valued versus um a dictatorship. I don't really like having someone or portraying myself as someone that is more important or uh just demanding. I would rather just be creating more uh team like environment. I feel like the productivity out of people and the willingness of people increases with that.

And I feel it's important to have effective communication skills because effective leadership and effective communication go hand in hand because as a leader when you have effective communication skills you're able to build a team that has a healthy way of communicating and you're able to voice out your ideas or opinions or whatever you know in a ravine healthy way without having to use um unnecessary power or to abuse your power and your position. We just have to read in a healthy way so that people are going to be able to follow you without feeling forced or feeling abused in any form and you also have empathy empathy is important to have as a leader because when you have empathy you're able to accept other people's opinions and you're able to understand that people don't experience the world the same are able to put yourself in your team leaders um and shoes start having to impose your own ideas. So as a leader, I am a very empathetic person. I am able to put myself in other people's shoes. I am able to accept other people's opinions and I don't have to voice out my opinions by imposing them on other people. I just have to voice them out and put them out there without having to impose them on other people and being creative and innovative. It's important because most of the time is that you are supposed to be making decisions and coming up with new ideas and innovative ways of dealing with situations or whatever decision that you had to take as a leader as a leader, I possess those qualities. And these qualities are very essential in being an effective leader and with confidence you have to have confidence in your overall skills that you have because if you don't believe in yourself no one else will you have to believe that you can do this leadership um being because if you don't believe in yourself, the rest of your team won't believe in you is what's the whole point of uh following a person that doesn't even believe in their own abilities or skills that they have. So if your team sees that you believe in yourself and you're confident in whatever decision that you make, they will follow you, they will definitely follow you and be inspired results because oh and risk taking is important. Um when you're a risk taker and you believe in whatever um risk that you're taking, people will be inspired to also take a risk in situations where a leader that leads them does that. So I think it's important as a leader to have these girls that I mentioned and amongst other ones that I did not mention.

Um I try to get activities to get to team motivated as well which is quite important to have that sort of efficiency on the team.

Um And he wouldn't take responsibilities for his mistakes as well. Um So my kind of leadership would be a more personal one, have a personal relationship with these people, have a personal um connection but also keep it professional. So. Mhm. Kind of have a sense of respect towards them but they should have respect, a sense of respect towards me, so they should come on time sort of like oh I don't want to get my manager, she is so good, I respect her work, I respect her as a person, therefore you know I'm I'm going to work towards it. Um I do believe that you know, being kind is also is also what gets you respect. And I think not having that kindness breaks a lot, a lot of teams. And just because you know, your life is miserable, doesn't mean your team has to be miserable. And I'm also very open minded when it comes to making mistakes. So if I do make a mistake, I'm very open minded, please tell me, tell me how can I improve, how can I improve it towards the team? But I do believe that there are a lot of people out there that don't have that same mindset. So there's leadership skills that obviously are quite useful which is obviously office 365 or all that computer skills, but truly it all depends on how you act as a person. Do you take responsibility for your mistakes? And I do believe I take responsibility. I believe I'm kind towards the team. I believe I have goals with that team as well. If I feel like someone is doing really well, um our group for them to, you know, become a trainer, maybe something even um higher then obviously there's that target every day that you need to hit.

And I've demonstrated this through, my colleagues have demonstrated this through training other people taking responsibility and sometimes people don't have to tell me the task, I'll just do it. And that's quite a good, a good motivation as well. And you have to be positive. Even when it's hard, when there's no stock, when there's no materials to do the job, you have to be positive, you have to give feedback to your workers if they're doing well if they're not doing so well. And that's just my way of being a leader. Because you have to lead the team, you don't essentially just follow each other like a headless chicken. You literally have to lead them into a better path into a better place, into a better um environment as well.

The skills and abilities that I have today are attained from my work experience. I've followed in the footsteps of the managers. I've seen achieved great things. But I've also seen firsthand from others what isn't appropriate as a manager. My experience as a manager has spread over five years, but prior to working within leadership roles, I began my career as a dishwasher at a busy restaurant. After dishwashing for six months, I became a waitress at the same restaurant. Remember thoroughly enjoying the work environment I was in and I can credit that to my manager at the time. From this employment, I moved cities and began my first role as a management assistant at a hotel. There were times where I would step up and take responsibility of my manager and the absence without being told. There was a time where I resolved a difficult complaint about a health and safety incident. I put the information. I have been taught into practice to successfully clear up the problem and the best way possible. While others may be able to do the job after being told once I prefer to watch others in my workplace and see how they deal with issues whenever the time comes for me to step up and take responsibility. I use what I have taught myself from others actions and apply it to the situation. So you could say that I don't need to be told once, but not at all. Whenever I have been advised of instructions, I have been the person that my colleagues come to for clarification. I've also ensured I am forced the instructions when appropriate and in the right manner because most of the time it's not what you're delivering, but how you're delivering it in the hospitality industry, you'll work with people from all walks of life and I have had extensive experience with communicating with all sorts of people. Even the most difficult of staff have advised me that they would refer to work with me. I think that I am compassionate but firm when it comes to communicating what needs to be done so no matter what the job is, that needs to be completed, I will make sure that either myself or another staff member will not only complete the task, but do it with a smile and with excellence after the task is done, I will always find time to thank other staff members for their time and their efforts in circumstances with a job as an up to scratch. I discussed this with the staff member privately and give them the opportunity to ask for support if they need it when someone isn't doing the best they can. I think it's important to first give them the opportunity to correct it because the happiest members of staff are the ones that feel they are in control and appreciated. I also ensure that whenever there is a problem caused by one person, nobody is singled out and blamed. But instead we all work to resolve the problem. I find being a team player, the most important part of being a manager. I'm not an authority but an equal and there is the first part of call, whenever there is a problem, whenever someone needs help, I also find that throughout my role, the most important skill to have as an answer for everything. I believe that everyone can always learn something or refine what they currently no. In fact, there have been many times when I have learned from the staff I am managing is somebody who is approachable. Whenever you need to tell me something or provide constructive criticism, I will be more than happy to discuss this. I want to enter every world knowing that I will be constantly improving. I think everything I've mentioned so far has been a great way of describing who I am as a manager, but at the end of every day I want to show that I am a loyal employee, that I am somebody who you can wholeheartedly rely on to get the job done and someone that will make sure that your other employees are happy and safe.

Also, I'm a personal communicates with people on a timely basis because the space that I work or requires compliance sometimes within a space of time. Um within 10 days or seven days you'll receive a letter that will tell you to have a responded in seven days and in that letter I shouldn't just be a response but a well researched response. So timely communication is key and also I am able to build a team by ensuring that information is shared and one respect the other, a skill that I do possess is a skill that another person does not have and I cannot have all the skills, I also ensure that people to share skills in order to reach a common goal at the end, I'm a flexible person, I can be, I can be placed in a team, work and perform and placed in an independent a task and I will also perform um a risk taker.

So risk taking is always key. I am also able to teach and mentor and those who know me in terms of building a team like I mentioned before, one needs to ensure that in building a team where I actually teaching, but actually actually ensuring that you are mentoring that particular person or that particular team and while doing so you are as patient as ever, like I mentioned and uh when I opened what is very important in terms of nature leadership, it is a combination of all the different skills, the leadership skills, it's not just a skill on its own.

I have been working in some capacity since I was 14 years old. So oh we're going back over 30 some years. Uh So I think I emerged as a leader early on every job I've ever had. I've been put into some sort of leadership position after being there for like a certain amount of time. And this goes as far back as you know, my part time job at Mcdonald's. Yeah promoted to shift leader. Um I think part of that leadership skill comes from like a desire from getting in starting at the bottom and working my way up that way. You learn everything along the way, you learn everything as you go. You learn how to work with people and you learn how to do the job and if you retain that knowledge you become good at it and you'll eventually get promoted. So when I started working in my career the same thing would happen. I'm not someone who moves around from job to job. I don't follow a paycheck. I like to get a job, keep a job and work my way up within that job. And in my last position, that's exactly what I did I've been there for 15 years I started the job. I worked my way up through Q. A. Eventually you know from tester to lead tester. And then when there's nowhere to go after that I started looking at other things within the company that I like to do and what that also did was it broadened my my knowledge about the company, about what we do and I moved from the software department into the content department. I stayed there for a few years, moved up into the marketing and advertising department which is where I am now and I just think the longer you stay, the more you know the better prepared you are to be a leader and to lead other people and you know leading other people what comes with that is being able to deal with all kinds of personality types. And at this point in my career I have dealt with so many different personality types that nothing fazes me. Um you know some people are easy to work with, some people are difficult to work with and it's all in how you react to them and I found a way to just deal with any personality type in a way that works just by being patient, by being sympathetic and just by trying to put myself into the shoes of the other person um that does not mean that you know, supervising people is not without its challenges, but I tried to come from a place of you know, first I am your peer, secondly I am your supervisor, so there is a level of respect that is due to me just for the position that I'm in but at the core of it, I am your peer, we are doing the same job, we're doing the same thing, I'm a human, just like you, I have problems just like you. So I would expect that level of respect that I give to also come back to me in any challenging situation. Ah you know, I do talk to people not as a manager, not as a supervisor, not as someone in power, but as as they appear, you know, let's get to the heart of what's going on, let's figure it out together. Tell me what I can do better and I will tell you what you can do better and will come to a place of mutual understanding. I feel like that's just really how I prefer to be managed. And so in turn, that is the way that I manage others. It has been successful for me All these years. I've managed teams of people, as many as um 16 freelance writers at one time down to just having one full time writer under me, which is where we're at now. I don't have any preference of one or the other.

I think it's important that you ensure that you have to communicate well with your team in order to succeed not only as a business, but also within the department, for example, if you're not communicating with your team, you're not working together successfully, creating quite a difficult environment to work within um especially since your own success within that team does actually lead further onto the success of the business, which is extremely important. Um I think besides that you really have to display very good problem solving um skills as well, because within your leadership role, you are going to face situations whereby you have got to solve problems and if you are unable to do that then it means you are going to have a more difficult time and you're not going to be a very good leader at all. Um problem solving is definitely really key, which is something that again, I'm very good at. I have continually shown that throughout my previous employment history when faced with different problems, either with customers or within the team itself, I think besides that you also have to be very empathetic um as a leader, as a leader, sorry, um purely because if you're not, you are creating that relationship with your team, which again, if you are creating relationships and actually building up your team, so they feel like they can succeed, they're going to work harder, they are going to ensure the success of both yourself and also the business. Um and within that you have to be an active listener, um you have to ensure that you, what's the word, sorry, um that you actually worked really hard with them um to maintain that relationship and have some self awareness as well. Um if you go in and you're sort of all guns blazing, you haven't got any empathy for your team, if you are very much case of, you know, just do the work, get it done, you're not gonna have a team that want to work hard for you that want to actually succeed and build you up and support you because besides supporting your team as a leader of the team, also supports you, so if you're not doing that, it means that you aren't gonna achieve the success that you want. Um I think you also have to be able to delegate as a leader, you can't take every single responsibility on yourself for everything. Um if you are able to delegate which I am, then you can actually ensure that everything is getting done to a high standard um and ensure that it is getting done correctly as well. If you are somebody who is going to um not delegate and just try and do it all yourself, your work is going to be worse, it's not going to have the greatest effect on you know the situation. Um so I think that's very important, I think you also have to take accountability for your actions as well, accountability is definitely very important when it comes to leadership, which again I am more than capable of doing um I think that's shown in my previous roles as well. Um I have had to take accountability several times when something's gone wrong. Um for the team it might not have been myself that had anything happen. Um if team member makes a mistake, that is still your responsibility as the leader, so you very much have to take that on board um and continue to do that throughout and you have to be able to collaborate as well with with your team with another team. You have to make sure that it works correctly correctly and ensure that everybody does succeed um you definitely have to within your team make sure that you do team building. Um as I said, you have to build that team up in order to succeed yourself and I think it's really important that you within that you're able to manage conflict as well. I think managing conflict is something that I've always had to do being an older sister, you know, it's always the way. Um but I think when you are a manager a leader you do very much have to ensure that you are able to um what's the lad manage that conflict, Sorry, because if you can't then you're almost letting the team down because if you if you are going to have conflict within the team, you do need to be able to manage that situation correctly in order to move forward and proceed and be able to continue on and succeed.",POSITIVE,0.6236,0.0133,0.2952,0.0678,809.0,LOW,5,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),12.34,1,0,0,"Associate degree (e.g. AA, AS)",Female,8.850525,8.57976,8.276699

Obviously there has been some expansion recently and our team has been amazing being able to adapt to that and still we're managing very, very well with the increased workloads and we're still continuing to deliver great results and and we are targets. I have had some leadership experience in the past in a previous job I was in charge of training the new employees. Some of these employees would come from similar backgrounds and they would already have quite a lot of knowledge and experience of the role but other employees would be quite knew they might be fresh graduates or they might be changing their career and so they have little knowledge already. So we've had to help them become very familiar with the company and our processes and their job role as well. So we've been training these people from scratch so to say um I have also been in charge of writing training manuals, foreign employees and also writing induction packs that employees are given when they first joined the company. Um I have been left in charge of the department on occasion and when management have been away, sometimes this is just to cover meetings or it could be for a longer period of time, for example, to cover a period of annual leave and during this time the team has always performed very well. We have continued to consistently achieve our targets and and manage our workloads and continue to deliver amazing results for our clients. Um I'm very interested in the position this position because as I've mentioned previously, I have been with the company a while now very comfortable within my job role. I am very confident in my abilities, I'm able to manage my workload effectively. Our targets are consistently being met, our clients are very happy and are frequently returning with excellent feedback. Um During my time at the company, we have expanded quite a bit. Um We've managed to retain great loyal clients, but also we have managed to attract new clients as well because they can see the amazing results that we're delivering for our existing clients and then they want to jump on the bandwagon, so to speak. Um I feel like I have been really great at helping my team adapt to the increased workload. We are still consistently meeting our targets, we are consistently outperforming our competitors and we are still coming back with this really great feedback. So now I feel like I'm comfortable enough in my current role um to be taken on some additional responsibility um so that I can continue to help my colleagues and we have quite a small team here.

So first of all, um I'm really good at the solution, I completely appreciate particularly a large team that I'm working at the minute, for example that buying is essential despite the fact that not everyone will necessarily agree with what you have to say or what your opinion is or how you're going to manage something. So I think it's really important to invest the time in your team, as individuals, as far as you can to talk them through your decisions whilst maintaining your reasoning and your leadership in the role, consultation is part of management. Ultimately the load is on my shoulders, I'm responsible, I'm the leader of the team. I've done this exceptionally well as you've outlined in my performance, management review, my current department, it shows that money for the next step. So that's one thing I think is extremely important. The second thing is credibility. Now you've spoken to momentary meetings about the presence around the school, making sure that invisible that I do duties, that everyone knows who I am and what I stand for and you can't depend on me recently and frequently about have managed to improve my profile in this area of employment. Um and so I feel therefore that I am ready to develop this particular leadership skill at the whole school level, which would be a necessity in terms of senior leadership team. So as well as those two things, um I think in addition that I have a high level of respect from all the different levels in the hierarchy and that I think is the third extremely useful and unique thing to me in terms of preparation for this job. So to provide you with an example, I have teachers from other departments come into asking me about how to manage things. For example, working on the E P. Q and asking me to present in my non status area training sessions on how to mark the peak, you know, I'm not the head of the PQ running a few years, but clearly teachers who are less experienced than me. For example, the teacher who runs the PQ as an exceptional professional themselves, trust me and respect me to do that whole stuff training regardless of the fact that I'm in a different position and in that department below them in the hierarchy. In addition, I've been complimented on my many assemblies, so for example, whole school in year assemblies raising my profile, was that in a second point, um and making sure that I am seen out and about as an authority figure, so the senior leadership team complimented me and respect me and that the students respect me. They see me as a key figure on the stuff they see me on duty out and about in my free time going into my colleagues lessons to show them support, show that we're in it together as a team, talking about the students explicitly with the teachers and talking to the students about what we've said to them discipline and where appropriate, both in a department and the whole school level. Um Also think about the different levels of hierarchy or the middle managers working with other heads of department heads of year to help particular students through difficult situations are being used, not just as somebody to support also as a consultant, effectively, the PQ train example being a really useful way of thinking about it. So it's the three areas that I think I'm exceptionally skilled in, as you said yourself and our performance management and that shows that if I'm forming an extremely high level in my current middle management role, ideally primed to move up to the next level.",POSITIVE,0.5705,0.0415,0.1148,0.2732,700.0,HIGH,11,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),10.27,1,0,0,"Master's degree (e.g. MA, MS, MEd)",Female,9.110171,8.830873,8.904932

You know I've worked with different departments such as the R. And D. Department. Um Working on the development of new products um The purchasing side where we're looking at inventory and bringing new items in along with sales where we're reaching out to customers. Um I've worked in with these teams both domestically and internationally. So I have a working understanding of the different cultures that we need to bridge the gap between um and to fulfill the types of products that our customers need. Um And so along with being a manager comes that sense of leadership and responsibility. And um 11 particular thing about me is that I really value beliefs from our minorities in our company. I don't feel that anyone should be discriminated against. Um and I think we should really uplift those who come from different backgrounds than ourselves so that we can get a more full picture and get better ideas coming to the table. Um For me that means more women in leadership, that means more people of color. That means more people in the LGBT community having their voices heard. Um And so along with that um mindset I try to see you know our employees as humans rather than numbers. So yes we are a business, we're growing um and we're thinking about the bottom line and how to reach it and exceed it. But the only way we're gonna get there is from dedicated um dedicated work from our employees and that's making them feel like they are human, they are a part of this team, they are not just you know, clocking the work, give a pay card clock out and they're done, they need to have pride in the work and I hope to instill that um in the way I manage my my team um and keep the keep the morale up and keep the camaraderie going. Um And in that sense I'm very good at delegating work. So I recognize that as a manager, I don't know everything and I'm not the best skilled at everything, which is why I have my team members, someone might be really really good at the at the accounting skills we need, someone might be really, really creative in the product development side and I'm okay with putting the ego aside and saying, you know you have the skill to make this work, so I'm gonna delegate this task to you and I think that a reflection of a great manager is the success of the employees underneath them. So when my employees are succeeding, I feel like I'm succeeding because I've um I've recognized their skills and I've allowed them to grow through that. And in that sense kind of combining with the morale, I will recognize employees when they go above and beyond and when they do a good job, I expect, you know, I expect a high level of attention to detail and good work ethic from my employees underneath under me, but I will be recognizing them for their achievements so that they have this morale, they have this team sense and that they'll they'll want to do more work simply because they have pride and joy and what they've been doing. Um And so along with all this, I think tying it together, you have to have someone in power who has good verbal and written communication skills. Um I think we can have a great sense of direction for the company, for the for the department, for the position, but without a way to effectively communicate that it's not gonna um we're not going to exceed our goals. So um I believe that I have that skill in writing and verbally in order to communicate to our team what is expected, what is needed um you know what will be rewarded and kind of the y and the purpose behind what we're doing because again that is just going to come back to that, fostering a sense of community of sharing different beliefs and of using those differences to come together as a whole team. Um I believe you know we all have something to offer here and the sum is greater than our individual parts. So as manager, I I wish to take these skills of delegation of speaking of written communication of seeing a vision and of combining all of these different skill sets into managing people, making them have pride in their work, um really coming together as a team to effectively get our business goals completed.

So um why would I be good in a leadership role? So basically um whilst I was deputizing for senior members of staff at the service desk it became apparent that the team was struggling with multiple Excel spreadsheets used to capture and maintain and statistics. So what was happening it was creating a lot of duplicate work causing data to been able to save. There was numerous users using the document at the same time. Um there was it was leading to so many mistakes and errors. So what I basically did was arranged team meeting where I got different stakeholders, colleagues, everyone together, we kind of investigated the problem. I found out what the issues were and determined what would make the process easier. I decided to take a full copy of the various spreadsheets that everyone had in the different departments. I did it outside of work hours so it didn't interrupt people in the day to day use. So I realized a lot of the day it was being captured twice and a lot of it some of it was not even relevant like we didn't even need it anymore. So it was slowing the program down. So what I did was I removed the information that we didn't need archived it which we then destroyed according with in accordance obviously with the G B G. D. P. R. Data I then combined the multiple spreadsheets into a single version and then retained renamed the tabs. So it made it easier to filter through and make the information more visible. Sorry just made the information more better when extracting it Um in regards to the statistics and things like that, that actually improved the workload the effectiveness of the quality. Everyone kind of had a clear understanding of their objectives, activities, the timeframes to do things obviously from changing that document, it sped up the process for a lot of people. So I did take a lot of ownership in that in progressing um apologies there. Um what else can I say? So other than that, my kind of skills, I would say tim building and coaching. I've done that before. I've kind of coached a number of people in different departments, different areas. I'm very sorry, I'm quite nervous doing this interview. I do have so uh what can I say? So rest, Sorry, um great deal patient, you're just going to refer to my notes, I hope that's okay. So I did kind of key point in things that I've done over the years. I'm just trying to think what's really relevant to my leadership side of things um and what I've done in taking ownership and help him obviously. So team building and coaching skills required from work in the government roles. So I always have a positive attitude which I think is really important to help and to listen to colleagues and stakeholders and the issues and problems have a great deal of patients, I'm always told how helpful I am with helping customers and colleagues and how I'm easy to come to if they have difficult issues so they may not want to speak to with somebody else. Um I'm highly organized even though a bit chaotic at the moment and I probably felt a bit nervous Because I'll be honest, it's the first time I've applied for jobs or started applying for jobs in 18 years. I've kind of been a single mom. So um that's been my priority. But obviously now the kids are rolled up. I want to start looking and going full time in some work. Okay so let's have a look at what also. So I've done a number of key roles really through from recruit, working for recruitment agencies to dealing with what we call was follow up. So we used to take I used to take vacancies, the departments work and pensions. So if an employer wanted to advertise a job I would take the description, I would put it on the systems and advertise it for him. I would take ownership and put the jobs outside. Advertise them. We'd put them with on out. So we had a central database that everyone went into. Would give it to our advisors in the job centers to try and promote the jobs to see if we can get customers into work. We would do follow ups as well to see how the interviews went, how the clients did the customers did. And just kind of end to end to find out that everyone is happy with the process, collect the feedback, find out if there's any areas that we can improve on what we didn't do so well. One. Um So I'm always eager to learn and advance my skills. As I say, this is very new to me interview, so I'm hoping that more interviews I get, the less nervous I'll get and I'll be able to prepare.

My role is really professional, involved, me allocating tasks to different professionals in the team that I was working with. And I also used smart measures to make sure these tasks have been completed. So that is specific, measurable, accurate, realistic and time specific. We would meet every so often and I would make sure that the people had completed their set tasks and ask some questions about what was preventing him from doing so if not in a really respectful manner. And this accountability of in the team meant that people respected me and they knew the role that they were meant to be doing. So. I'm also a very organized person in my current role. I'm in a very busy role and making sure I need to do paperwork that gets filled out on time while making sure I'm supporting the people I'm working with. I also volunteer my time and spent lots of the last year training to complete a triathlon. And so yeah, all things that a very important in a management role. Say when I was training to become a social worker um a little while ago Ir at uni, I was also a pair mentor to students in years below me. So this role would involve being really supportive to them and asking some questions kind of about what's happening for them any errors they're struggling with and helping them come up solutions with themselves about how they can make their situation better and what they can do say I have an extensive amount of experience within the role that I'm applying for. I've been working in this organization for a significant period of time and because of that, I feel I have the skills and experience that means I can work in this area as a manager whilst working in this area have also taken on some management responsibilities, so that is included and some administration tasks and I've also supported other members of staff with a management position. There are times when you need to be able to speak to the staff about things which aren't happening or where their practice isn't quite good enough and this is something, but although challenging to do, I do find comfortable doing an example of when I did this previously, when I was working with another member of stuff and I didn't feel like she was putting her all into work and I felt like she was taking lots of breaks and the way she was going about her work was preventing her doing to do a really good job and I kind of pulled her to one side and I had a bit of a frank discussion with her and I said, I know you really care about the work, you do that, there's kind of these things that I've noticed recently that made me concerned for kind of how you're going about your job. And it was a conversation that I wasn't used to having with a pair, but I felt it was really important, do you say, to help them do the best they could be. And it's a conversation. I had a really good outcome as she really changed her behavior for a period of time and recognize kind of what she wasn't doing as well.

So I encourage people that work within people that work within my group of people to interact by so doing we have activities that we might do during working hours or after working hours, like going out to go watch movies together or going for team building activities that helps with strengthening the strengthening the team and helps people in the team, getting to know each other. So that's how I lied, I lied with three things I live with the fact that I know these people are human beings and then they also have other things outside of work that might affect their work progress. I lead with the fact that this will have their own expertise and knowledge that they bring to the table. So I allow them to be team leaders as well, to manage projects. So I allow them to do that as well and then I believe in the reward system and to to appreciate people. So I appreciate and I show them by having ours or recognitions and I believe in teamwork so we do team building activities to strengthen the team had always and my abilities and capabilities is that I will go well with others and I'm good at conflict resolution. I understand two sides of the story all the time. I work very hard and I'm dedicated and I I'm very innovative. I come up with ideas that could better situations. Yes. And I'm always up for a challenge if if something comes off as challenging to others. I'm the one always willing to do it at all times. I'm always looking for something challenging because that pushes you to learn new skills that you would not have necessarily learned if you didn't push yourself out of your comfort zone. So those are my capabilities. I'm hard working, I take initiative, I challenged myself, I work well with others and I'm very dedicated and I do my work and I make sure that I submit on time. Yes. And I tend to cross check everything just to make sure that it is alright? So I I double check everything which might at times be a little cost, it takes a little bit of time, but I want to make sure that before I send something through it is fixed and it's readable. I mean it works well. So that is me and my abilities and I always support the people that I work with and I also encourage them to become better. I don't do any, I do the job.

My main duties in that role were to delegate the abundant task, uh, related to communications to my team members and, of course, reviewing all of that work before it went out publicly, Um, that included both traditional and digital media. What is very important, obviously, both as a communications professional and as a leader is communication skills. Um, I at this juncture in my career, have become very good at effective communication, both within my organization and externally, with stakeholders partners, etcetera. Um, it's very important, obviously to, uh, ensure that my communication is clear with my employees so that tasks are getting done the most effective and efficient way possible. And I have been able to do that in my recent position as a communications manager. Further to this, I am have excellent motivational skills. I think it's very important when you're managing a team of people to keep your team motivated. In order to do that, I ensure that while I not only, um, let my my team know when they're doing really well, I also find ways to positively let them know when there is any sort of issue correction, et cetera. For example, if a team member of mine writes a press release and it's not exactly what I was hoping for, I would not go back and say, This is not what I wanted at all. This is wrong. Redo it. I would tell them exactly where they went wrong, but again in a positive way. So maybe the angle wasn't exactly correct. Or maybe there were a couple of grammar errors. So attention to detail wasn't great in that moment for that person. Um, like, I would gently go through their piece of writing with them and just point out, you know, this, uh, this this part was really good, and this part was really good, But maybe we could do a little something else with this part of that part. So it's really important again, um, in motivating your team to let them know when they've done really well, but also to let them know how they could improve. Because that is, what is important for any professional individual is improving along the way in their career. We all want to improve and it's really important to me to to allow and show my team members where they can improve. Um further to this, delegating is a very important piece of being a manager, knowing who to delegate, a task to when to delegate a task and maintaining the hierarchy of importance when it comes to the work that needs to be done. Knowing that that's one team member might be stronger at a certain piece of work than another. So maybe if that's a piece of work that needs to be completed a little more quickly or efficiently. I might delegate that to Team Member is opposing team member Be because I know team member is stronger in that area. That doesn't mean that Team member be isn't strong or isn't doesn't have stronger abilities in other areas. But it is. It is a point of knowing What's what's the best way to delegate the work, because you know at the end of the day, especially as it pertains to communications because it's it's a 24 hour forever going area. It is important to be able to delegate test so that the work is being done efficiently and efficiency is always. That's something that's going to be important when it comes to communications work. So, yeah, knowing the best way to delegate the work is really, really important. Another hugely important piece for me personally in being a leader and a manager is maintaining a positive work environment. Um, I do not want my team coming to work and not looking forward to their day. Um, not wanting to be there, um, et cetera.

Um and particularly in terms of leaving a team in that industry. So for example, i in the last three rolls I worked my way up from team leader, the team manager to department head. Um and in that time I've worked with a vast range of people from very diverse backgrounds um and lead them to achieve objectives. Um one example would be that we um I led the implementation of a new accounting system and in order to do that, had to bring people together within my own team, but also from other sub teams um within the organization and that were directly under my control and in order to lead that project and it meant that I had to adapt my leadership style to meet the needs of different people's personalities and also to be able to translate the objectives of the project into something that was meaningful to them. So, for example, we wanted our accounting system to reconcile to our HR system. So to do that, we needed our HR team to get to get involved and and bring our systems together. However they initially they couldn't see the reason why they needed to be involved in this project, because finance is very separate to HR in our organization. However, by translating the benefits of what they could achieve and how we could add value to the organization strategic goals by linking both those systems together, I was available to draw them in and and really engaged from a very senior HR director to bring them into the project um And then also lead by example and bring others into the team and ensure that my team was working well with their team. The other thing I'd say I got a vast range of experience in terms of managing staff with different ability, so I've got have had experience of real high flyers in my team, I've actually wanted to develop them and send them on NBA programs etcetera so that they could really achieve the full their full potential and sometimes that means um unfortunately leaving my team and securing a more senior role but I feel that's a really positive achievement for myself um on the on the other extent I've also had people that have struggled a little bit and sometimes it for a range of reasons that I've had to manage, so it might be someone that's got a disability and it's about how we can ensure that they feel um able to do their role to the best of their ability and meet and meet the needs of the role of also being a bit supportive to them and saying it was different ways of working. So for example enabling one of my staff to work from home was really changing for them. They have not been allowed to do with the previous manager really made a difference to them and they were able to form much better um and also people that may be a poorly performing for other reasons, making them trying to understand why and trying to change that behavior. I've got experience of that and performance managing those people so that they achieve um what we need them to achieve in the organization. And the final thing I'd say is that I've also got another key thing of leadership that I feel is that you've got to really be able to translate the organizational strategy as to what it means for an individual. I've definitely got that ability, I can communicate to my finance team, how um how we need to do our roles in order to meet that to ensure that our organization is sustainable and it offers value for our shareholders and without doing that and our customers and without doing that, we will cease to exist. Um so I'm really keen and on each project, and I set anyone in my team that they're clear how that their role in that project is making a difference to the organization overall and our customers and our shareholders and shareholder value.

Yeah, communication is really, really important. Bush. So is the experience and skills that I bring to the job and the experience that I've had as um working for good managers and you take the best of people and you use those um You build doors into strategies that you use yourself. So for example, the very best management managers, I've worked for all those that are very loyal to you and those who will roll the sleeves up to be honest and get stuck in themselves. So this is something that I do as well. I'm very loyal to the people who work for me. I am very supportive and I like to think I have a strong and caring side of me that shows through, I don't like to see people stuck. So yes, if I sense that people are overworked and perhaps in distress, then yeah, I will roll my sleeves up and get involved as well. And that is something that I do very often and it's not a bad thing to be honest, because it keeps you on your toes, it keeps you grounded. It ensures that, you know, what's going on, um, on the ground and you can react quite quickly because you've got a full knowledge of um, any particular situation. So I think that's really important as the leader. Yeah, don't be frightened to get your hands dirty. Um, another thing that I think is really important is to challenge, not to be too accepting. So if you feel that something maybe isn't right. If people are being put on, if your department is being um put into a lot of pressure, what's wrong with challenging the status core? It's not good to be yes person. I think you will almost look better for being a no person or um, you know, I'll do that when I've got time. So I think challenging and being realistic about your goals as well is vital. Talking about goals. Setting goals is crucial to success because if you don't know what your goals are, how do you know, when you've reached them, how do you know how far away you are from achieving them? Are you even going in the right direction? And this will pull back into communication? So that constant talking to colleagues, management of the employees, of the departments is ensuring that your goals are are achievable, um, the attainable and yes, that you, you're on the right path really, and um finally, just what the other thing I would like to mention as as a good leader is if you are in a situation and you feel that you are under.",POSITIVE,0.8073,0.0009,0.19,0.0018,604.0,MED,9,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),16.05,1,0,0,"Bachelor's degree (e.g. BA, BS)",Female,10.01368,9.726798,9.463909

I was working recently For 30 years. Indeed. In a local primary school, I wasn't managing any adults in this rule. But I was managing the behavior I'm learning Of Children generally age 9- 10. This is quite challenging role. Uh huh. Different every day. one has to manage behavior as well as learning outcomes. Hand is a very interesting and worthwhile role, although not very well paid prior to that. I was working in science where a number of technicians reported to myself and others. Yeah, this was a very frustrating role and the only time I've had to manage adults directly, none of us seem to be able to encourage these technicians to work conscientiously. Indeed, most of my colleagues gave up trying. I was the only one left directing these individuals, I must say it's one of the hardest things I've ever done. It makes working with Children seem a lot easier on a day to day basis. Um I would work with different groups of small Children, small groups of Children and I think it's fascinating to see how the relate to each other, how they cooperate or don't cooperate. How do you have different learning styles? And each one to some extent requires an individual approach obviously though collectively in a class of charity. Um that's not always possible, but we all seem to have a pretty good relationship was lost somewhat less than a year and then these individuals move on, move on to senior school probably. And a new bunch comes in. So in a way I've never had an extended period working with the same individuals for more than a year at a time when the pandemic struck, I didn't feel it was safe to be in a classroom situation and opted out for a while. So actually I'm really desperate to get back to some sort of working rule doesn't really miss it. That's not really relevant to your study. I can't actually imagine what sort of job you might be considering would be a management role in a school. Yeah. Other than the Children, I would add, it was much, much harder interacting with kids over the internet. It just doesn't work the same way.

I've obviously started this career since september now, but I have previously had a career in management in a summer camp industry for seven years, so there's a lot of skills that I've learned throughout that career that I think are hugely transferrable within the education industry. Um First of all, in terms of organization, I know it's essential that a leader has organization skills and especially within a fast paced environment, are able to prioritize um a prioritized and get things actually done. And that's something that I do have experience of, especially when working in the summer camp industry all year round, looking Parents on talking to parents um and getting the camp ready for the summer, but also within the camp where I've managed up to 40 members of staff 120 students and as organization for example, I've had to have the camp ready to go set up um to welcome all of these students in, make sure the staff already, they know what they're doing and to settle the kids into the correct rooms to ensure activities are going ahead, trips are going it ahead and are safe. Um and as well, just making sure paperwork, the correct paperwork has been completed. So organization is essential to actually the smooth running of a business and that's complete transferrable within the education industry as well. Um in particular as well, I would say, being personable and approachable was a huge quality that I have as a leader and something that I could bring to this new role in managing a staff team, it's hugely important. You are approachable and people want to come and talk to you and you have a positive energy that people feel like they can't, they do actually want to talk to you and um can invest time in you and explain, maybe explain their worries. So that is how I think being possible approachable and how you can get a team working together really really well and actually ensure that people are actually doing their jobs um being adaptable, so for example, I have had situations in the past where something hasn't been quite to plan and we have had to adapt within the last minute on what we're going to do. For example, I've had it where I've had staff members have suddenly been sick, they were meant to be running evening activities and I've had to adapt. Maybe I also had to use my own skills and just take over the situation and run an activity myself last minute without any planning. I've had to adapt in terms of moving the jigsaw puzzle of staffing around to make sure that um people are in the place that I want them when someone is unwell and actually, although a lot of things are happening in the background that the Children were running the camp forward don't actually realize that and I actually think everything is smooth sailing from the front, from the front of the service. Um making decisions is hugely important as a leader. You can't, people procrastinating, you can't be take too long in making decisions, you have to think things through logically and ensure that it does make sense. It makes sense. The parents in particular in my previous job. It makes sense that the staff and there's a reason why we're doing things. So for example making decisions, we've had it before where we've had staff members take Children to the airport and they've missed out on the flight. And that's for me in a high pressure environment and then decide what to do. Actually make a decision. Are we going to book a flight? Um, are we not going to book a flight and how to get this child's home safe if it's possible? So yeah, I think all of those things organization, being personable, approachable, being able to adapt in a high pressure environment and prioritizing and making decisions are really, really important.

That's something I enjoy doing very much because I'm highly organized. I usually joke that I have open tops in my head at all times and that can be a blessing and a curse. But in terms of managing roles and leadership styles and skills that works very much to my benefit. Um it's almost like I have a workflow operating in real time all the time and I have been engaged in this type of skills and roles from my university days, I led many student societies, I founded some when I noticed that there was a need for it, but it didn't exist. An example of that, who America's at the BBP University with the law school and I founded that organization, set up a committee and also was able to secure a certain amount of funding which would continue year upon year uh to further the cause of Amicus, which deals with, you know promoting the right and fighting for the right uh focuses who are on death row in the U.

Whether to that I love working with people, I love doing teamwork. I have engaged in that, like I said over many years I have over 15 years experience um working with various companies from retail to charity to shipping. Um I've worked in finance, I've worked retail, I've worked in admin and what all of these jobs have done is that really shipped me uh to be able to work with people at all levels. So not only my superiors, uh for lack of a better word, but also persons who are working at the same level with myself opposites, that I would be managing how to handle conflicts, um how to deal with a situation that might pop up out of the blue, unexpected, you know, the circumstances like unexpected sicknesses. Uh if a project might run over these are all things that I have handled in a real time, um, and done well, have taken time to ensure that my strengths now lie in that area and things that may have been witnesses before. I have taken detailed steps to ensure that I have worked on them. Um, so yeah, this is a, this is why I feel that I've been really good feet for this role.

I, you know, at least I haven't anyways, I also like to think I'm very helpful.

My name is lucy and I think I'd be the perfect candidate for this job because management for me it isn't a job, just a job for me it's something that I enjoy doing and that I have done pretty much my whole life when I was a child. Um managing play of my siblings to being elected as deputy head girl in my school as a teenager. Um to completing my Undergraduate degree in business management. And then since then having just over 10 years experience of management within the charity sector. For me, I know the perils of a bad manager and haven't been managed by a poor manager and also how a good manager allows their employees to thrive and how that can benefit both the employees, the business, the projects and the manager themselves. So for me I seek to be that sort of manager manager who um equips their team, uses their skills and and really let everybody spread their own wings and be given autonomy so that everybody can reach their personal goals as well as the business goals. I think I'm a great manager because I really care about the people who I manage. I think that some managers would just view people as a resource to get the job done. Whereas for me I care about people and I think that's how you get the best out of people by showing them understanding and care. I was recently described in a 1-1 with my manager as an exceptional manager with a big heart and I think that sums up exactly what I stand for. I'll never be somebody who micro manages or stands over people's shoulders watching what they're doing instead, I look to give people the confidence to operate without my input all the time. I think that's a very important part of managing. As I've mentioned, I have nearly 10 years experience of managing within the charity sector, this includes hiring, managing people, performance management, sometimes firing people, project management, event management, office management and also volunteer management. I think all the different aspects of management require different but similar skills and I feel that over my last decade I really fine tuned these skills and I don't feel um like there would be any other candidates who have the breadth of experience that I have. Um I was throwing the deep end and I think because of that I have really flourished. Um I think well what's really important is that a major both enables themselves to have, have an eye for detail as well as looks at the broader pictures. They can both ensure accuracy and detail in the foreground, but also push the project forward and that is something which I both um enjoy doing something that I'm really good at.

Growing up, I was a highly competitive dancer, and I spent many years leading our dance team in training and competition, et cetera. And in that experience, I learned how to balance different personalities on a team and make sure everyone was communicating effectively. In that environment, a big challenge was always managing the conflict that would ensue between team members who had differing viewpoints and goals for the team, et cetera. For example, Um in that dance team, one team member was really struggling with performance anxiety and would easily freeze up on Competition day. In particular, another one of the team members would express a lot of frustration towards the other team member who was experiencing experiencing anxiety, And I would have to mediate the conflict that ensued between them by making them both explain their frustration calmly and rationally. Uh, and then they would most often reach a mutual agreement where they would work well together, at least for that day. In that kind of high stress environment, which emulates the workforce pretty accurately, I think in my schooling I also encountered many team members, um, and environments that faced similar challenges to my younger years. Particularly, I lead an APP development project in school where some team members were just not performing very well and not completing their work on time. I had to discuss this with them and maintain my composure while basically telling them their work was not up to the standards set by myself or the group. And this was always a challenging discussion and was uncomfortable but ultimately led to them performing better and then being happy with the final result that our team created by the end of the project. And it was a difficult learning curve to learn how to basically tell a team member that what they were doing was not good enough. Um, it was a learning curve for me to get over that discomfort level, um, to have that discussion. But it was an amazing learning opportunity, and I feel very comfortable at this point in my life and career dealing with conflict in a calm way. And, um, you know, leading somewhere that is actually going to be successful. Uh, and then in my professional life, I've also been a part of several development teams with anywhere from 4 to 10 team members. Approximately and in those experiences, I learned how to work well with my team members and definitely communicate my own strengths and weaknesses. And I learned that it was really important to have those discussions about our strengths and weaknesses at the beginning of the work time, instead of letting those frustrations build to a point where conflict would occur between us and I had to balance my relationship, of course, with my superior and my relationships with my team members, and that at times there is always a challenge. But in the end, I learned communication is key. That is, that that is what solves most issues in team environments and and yeah, So through all of these different experiences, I've witnessed both healthy and unhealthy team environments and leadership, and I've really seen what works well and what doesn't.

Um, also on top of that, I do run my own column, so I have my own clients, so it's kind of like a constantly ongoing role that I'm working in the salon, and I'm also helping to manage the stuff. Um, I really enjoy it because it's so rewarding to um watch people grow and develop their professional skills and as well as their personal skills. Um, Obviously sometimes there's certain things that are harder to deal with, but I think that over the past five years, I've learned a lot of people skills, a lot of people management skills, how to approach things and what works for different personalities, because how you might approach one person and what gets a good reaction from them and get the results you want from them might not be how you approach somebody else. Um And I think that's really key to keeping the team happy um And also being able to execute what the owner wants, even if that's not exactly what you agree with, kind of making sure that you really got that role to support the owner as well.

I've got several years experience in this area and I've already got significant experience leading a team of both volunteers and paid staff. I really enjoy working with people. I consider myself to be a good motivator. Um, I enjoy chatting with them and finding out what their strengths on how they can best contribute to the team. I've got very conscientious and have a good eye for detail, which I think is very important if you're going to get project through unfinished. Um, I've got quite a significant amount of experience in handling difficult situations with individuals, whether it be personality issues or simply that they haven't got the necessarily skills or understanding to undertake job. Um, if that's the case, then I like to identify what their weaknesses are and see if we can address them. Because I think if each individual within the team is working to the best of their ability, then overall the job's going to get done too much much higher standard. I'm a great believer in communication. I like to have regular meetings with all my staff and find out how they're finding the work. Um, if things aren't going well, I want to know early so I can address any issues and we can get the team back on track again. I also like to organize some off stream social events for my team. I think it's very good that they actually get on as individuals, as well as professionals. Um, let's face it, we're all human beings, we're not machines and it's important that they get to enjoy the work they're doing now. Management isn't always as straightforward as you would hope it to be. There's an awful lot of work that has to be done in the background before you ever get to start a job and I think planning is essential, you're not going to get anywhere just winging it all the time, although there are occasions where that is necessary and I think it's also valuable for your team if they can know exactly what's required of them, what the job entails, what's expected and it means they can prepare individually both in a practical sense in making sure they've got materials and other things that are required for the job. And also psychologically, I think if you dump um tasks on people unexpectedly, although they often rise to the challenge and can perform very well. I don't think you often get the best out of them. It's also very valuable I found to have feedback from my team. Um you may feel a job's gone well, they may not and it's very important that you have this level of communication where they feel free to actually discuss what they feel didn't work as well as it should have dug and also that they have um the opportunity to have their input and say how they think um task could be improved, this empowers them. And again I think it improves their individual performance and as such, you get a better, better result from your team as a whole, I'm also very keen on recording and keeping track of excuse me and keeping track of um tasks as they've gone along. And if there are other follow up jobs that need to be done afterwards. And I think this coordination of the bigger picture is very important to keep things moving along smoothly and I think this is something that I excel at. I'm a very optimistic person, very upbeat, enthusiastic and I think I can convey a lot of this to my team, so um yeah, I think I'm the best candidate for the job and I look forward to hearing from you in due course.

That's really, really important imperative, even that might sound a bit obvious, but many, many english language schools are actually run by people with great business experience, but without um teaching experience, which means that they're sometimes can be a disconnect between management and teachers, and even more importantly, between management and students, because the students themselves are the clients, they're the ones that we really need to connect with. And so I think that extra thing that I can bring to the table is not only my management experience having um uh manage and lead other language schools in the past, but also with my teaching experience so that I can really understand the what teachers will go through um and what typical student needs might be apart from that, I think what's really, really important to me, what my biggest purposes Um in this arena is two address the lack of diversity um in management. Um and indeed in in english language teaching, because in my previous experience working abroad and using typical english language teaching materials. Um I did not see myself in the materials that I was using, and that was a real shame. And that was a little bit uncomfortable. And so actually a way that I got around it was by sharing simply pictures and stories of my own family and friends and trying to um highlight how multicultural, how diverse um London is, for example, my own hometown. So I really something that's really really important that what I want to bring to this role is more diversity, more inclusion. I think that I am very transparent. I and someone who wants to keep the door open and um to have open communication again amongst the the management team as well as the teachers and um yeah, I think that's one of my strengths. Um again relating back to the fact that I have About 10 years teaching experience under under my belt and feeling a real connection with teachers as well as students having studied languages myself. Um Yeah, I think that having purpose wanting to bring diversity and inclusion um into the mix being transparent, open and transparent and most of all accountable being very very open to accountability and trying to um um standby whatever decisions and take important stances whether it be in relation to climate change to movement, black lives matter, these big global issues.

One being is that I have very good communication skills on the projects that I'm leading at the moment. I have to communicate with a lot of internal and external stakeholders. So communication I have. I'm always on communicating whether it's via email, where is via Microsoft teams, whether it's or a phone call, I'm always on the go about communication, making sure everybody is on track with their tasks, making sure all the, all the risks have been sorted out, the issues have been sorted out, you know, so I'm always on track and communicate with the team. Even I'm making use of Microsoft teams, the chats as well so people can communicate with one another and I'm always make sure we always have weekly team meetings for all the projects that we have so that even if it's just half an hour so that everyone can communicate their skills, communicate what has been done and all the tasks that have been done. So one thing that I think I can bring to this management position is communication. Next is delegation. As I said, I'm working on many, many projects, medium size projects. Lost art projects, financed projects, hate child for you shop projects, charity projects. So I'm idea of a lot of internal and external stakeholders. So delegating the task to various different people within their, when the party is one school say I have, I know what I've been in the organization for a long time, so I know what um skills, people can bring to the projects and I know so I I know who I can delegate this task tasked with the internal with the external, I can know who I can meditate this task to. So that's one thing I can bring to this position. Next thing is that I'm I like to motivate people when we have, when we have our projects meetings always motivate the team to do to keep going to keep you know, everyone, even if they have any issues with the task, you know, I just keep saying you've done great so far you've done great so far, you know, you can keep going, keep going, keep trying to achieve order to all the talks that you have been assigned to, you know, try and motivate them as a team and you know, at the beginning of the of our purchase meeting that just have like a time of like um just not not too not too serious at the beginning, but just the time of check chat so people can just overlaps and you know, before we get into the into the actual project task and then motivate them continue to make the bottom and that also leads into um tim building, I'd like to build up the team, making sure, you know, everything is, you know, all their task uh you know out there and making sure they if they need anything to help with their tasks, you know, if they need support if they need another person and need an extra hand, hand on their task. I've always said today to build them up and bring it extra stakeholders in the project of need being and also I like to be one of my office skills is integrity and honesty.

You know, I'm always there, let's open and honest. I don't like to sugar coat things always just open and honest with everybody in nothing. Another woman of my toss of my skills is I'd like to collaborate with many, many different people, bring different, very different areas within the organization and bring them together. Let's collaborate, let's talk, let's understand what the problem is. Let's transport the let's find the solutions. I like to collaborate with different types of teams.

If I were to give you some examples from my current job, I am a teacher and in my job I have to manage to other members of staff to make sure that we get the best of those Children. And I make sure that in the morning when they come in they have got a plan readily made for them that lists out in bullet points, clear instructions for today for the day. If I feel as though they are not doing something appropriately or up to effective standards, then I will call them over and model it to them. Usually though I model the activity to them beforehand so that they get a good understanding of how I'd like them to perform it rather than them just having written instructions, they also get to watch me do something so that then they know how to also do it. Um I also feel that I am a very inspiring person. So the people that I work with usually say that they enjoy working with me and that's because I inspired them to do their best. I make sure that I'm offering a lot of praise as well so that they know when they're doing something correct, I'm constantly giving them feedback and I wouldn't just pull them up when it's something that I feel like they're not doing correctly. So I make sure that I call them up and I'm saying, hey I really like what you're doing here. So yeah, I do believe that it's important to be both inspirational by showing that I'm enjoying the job and so therefore they could also enjoy the job, but to also be very positive with my feedback with them as well, I see that I take every opportunity as a learning opportunity. So yeah, as I say, if I see them doing something that's perhaps not to the correct standards and of course I would show them how to do. So I believe that I enjoy learning new skills to become a better leader each and every time I attend training courses where I need to, I will ask those even above me for extra training to see what I can better enhance my own leadership skills. I am very good at problem solving. So an example of that would be when we had a child in classroom was flying about something and disclosing some information to me, I made sure that the other Children were set off doing a task and I took that child to one side to deal with that. I'm also very flexible, I am understanding of last minute changes and I'm able to really adapt myself and yeah, I'm also able to delegate tasks really, really well feel like that's a really important part of being a leader, It's super important to be able to just delegate tasks appropriately. So that every adult underneath me or working alongside me has each got a really good role to play that's impacted the bigger picture. Yeah. Um, I also believe that I'm a good mentor as well. So like I said earlier on our model, how something should be done, then I'll watch how that member of staff does it and if they're doing it correctly or if they're not doing it correctly, if there's still areas for improvement, I will show that I will help them with that. I'm also make sure that I make sure that, as I said earlier that I'm very positive and also approachable so that if any of those people or any of my staff had any questions or wanted X training on something they feel comfortable with coming to ask me about that rather than dreading coming to speak to me that wouldn't, that wouldn't to me make a good leader at all, it wouldn't mean I've got good communication skills, it wouldn't mean that I am approachable, it's a whole really, um, yeah, so those are some of the things that I believe make me good leader, I also think I'm very self aware as well. So I'm constantly evaluating my own abilities, I'm constantly thinking about what I've done what I could do even better for the next time. So at the end of the week, sometimes at the end of the month, I will sit back and reflect on the month, think about the things that have gone really, really well And then I also think about the things that have perhaps maybe not going as well and what goals I've got for the next um, the next month, for the next town. So I make sure that I'm always keeping on top of my goals for myself and for the rest of the team as well. And so yeah, I'll make sure that I'm very approachable. I think that's one of the main important things of being a leader and a good leader at that as well. Yeah, I also like to make difficult conversations really easy as well. If there's something that I've noticed, I might bring it up in quite a friendly man. I would never bring up something in a really horrible, serious manner. Or in front of loads of people as well would obviously be quite assertive, but only when I need to be. So that's only when I've got to tell someone something a lot of times.

Um I do have a decent amount of experience in management prior to um coming into this organization. Um I first actually started pretty young when I was about 18 years old. I was working in retail, it was my first job and I kind of climbed the ranks through good work and dedication and all that sort of thing and I ended up being a manager at only 18 and I wasn't managing a lot of people um but it was mostly young girls around my age and that's when I kind of started building the foundation and learning what a successful manager looks like. Um I'm not gonna lie when I was younger, I was a little bit more black and white and uh impatient and I want to say unsympathetic to the diversity of staff around me and through my experience there and then my experience at Costco in a management position where there is so much diversity. I started to learn about the positives of having such a diverse staff because the more diversity, the more opinions, the more potential for growth and different ways of thinking. So um That was in my early 20's and I it's a lot more responsibility in my management job there than I had at my first retail job. Just because Costco is such a huge organization and um there's a lot expected out of managers that I wasn't necessarily used to but had to acclimated to. So I definitely learned there different things that I learned in my first job and it was more about learning how to cater to my staff and help them succeed, giving them the support and the tools and the appreciation in order for them to feel motivated to do their job well. And also feel motivated to learn how to continue growing as well as feeling valued, which is a very important thing when you're a staff member and I feel like when I was an employee at Costco, I didn't feel as valued and I felt more like just a number. So I started to use that to really make my employees feel valued and appreciated and like I was there for them if they needed it. So now I work as a teacher. Um so I'm not necessarily managing uh people, but I am definitely managing Children which is its own um beast to wrangle. And it's definitely made me more empathetic. Um I feel like I've been on this journey of just getting more and more empathetic as I grow older and taking into consideration that everybody is different and everybody brings different things to the table and everyone has different strengths and weaknesses and their weaknesses are not weaknesses, but they're just areas that they need a little bit more assistance with. So it's a lot of patience, A lot of support and I also found that with Children in particular I've learned the need to be flexible yet still very um what's the word structured and I think that this is beneficial for adults as well, because everybody likes to know what is expected out of them, um And they also need to be supported and be able to um perform what they need to perform, but in a flexible way that is best suited for them. So I've actually been shadowing my superior and she's showing me how to be flexible and join me how to be patient. And I think I just threw my Last 10 years of um being in management positions. I've really grown and learned that you do have to be structured, but you also have to understand that these are people, and we come in all shapes and sizes and flexibility, and support is key.",POSITIVE,0.5336,0.0081,0.4561,0.0023,647.0,HIGH,14,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),13.96,1,0,0,"Master's degree (e.g. MA, MS, MEd)",Female,8.936527,8.658687,8.376374

Um Prior to entering university held a number of jobs. All that could be clusters sort of mm second income but that decries from the nature of some of the roles because in each and every one, I learned a great deal um about working in teams, working together how leadership works in different environments and how successful it is in those different environments. Um Once once I graduated and the degree was in business management, Marketing, international relations, decision making studies, Leadership. Um I was fortunate enough to getting a good job almost after graduating um with a company that dealt with training and education and that was one of my main interests at the time. Um I lead a small team of six people providing management and training opportunities to a large number of people who worked within the aerospace industry. So it was anything from health and safety up to management skills, leadership skills, communication and so we run the gamut of training and education opportunities there. We also offered online learning which was really helpful for a lot of the staff members because it was something that could do in their own time and basically was unsupervised the team itself, although I was the leader and manage them, we worked best together pulling ideas and learning from each other, We all came together as Older people actually of 40, some of us with a vast experience in different areas, so it would be foolish not to build upon those skills and experience and that's why I chose to do as a leader. Um unfortunately that job was just a temporary contract, so we all had to seek further employment and I was lucky enough to found a similar position, but within the voluntary sector, on a new project that had been started in a nearby city um initially I was sort of involved on the finance and administration side, building on previous skills, but again, the nature of the job and the nature of the project was such that we are all um chipped in our various levels of expertise and although I was in a leadership role looking after younger members of staff and that was fine, you know, I mean obviously there had to take more of a leadership role and but again it worked best when we all came together and pulled our ideas and individually we're able to offer what the project needed at any given moment in time and that works really well. Um unfortunately that's that project ran out of funding and after that, I just took really any role that helped bring in the penis, but what I bring to a job like this is in a leadership role like this is fast years of experience in different spheres, both in the public and in the private sector.

Just to clarify, I currently work in the recruitment industry within the industrial sector. Um So the reason why I'm looking to progress into a more managerial position um is because I have quite a few years under my belt within the industry, you know, quite experienced in what I do, I'm gonna matter level where um I have explored different areas of the industry um and gained enough knowledge to be able to progress on to the next stage. I see myself within a leadership position, I'm quite comfortable with that type of role. I'm quite comfortable um managing and training other individuals of staff. So currently with what I do, I'm responsible for both clients and candidates with with the clients I'm responsible for. Sometimes these are much bigger projects that I deal with, some of which I deal with completely on my own. So I very much have to manage myself as well within the process, I'm responsible for managing their expectations, guiding them through the process, keeping them up to date. Um And in addition to that I'm also responsible for recruiting candidates for certain roles for these clients, so that would be completing the whole start to end process with them. Um So I deal with processing applications, reviewing applications or sourcing new candidates from other other areas. Um I'll deal with their individual applications and CVS um I'll interview them process their documentation and their right to work um and then I'll coach them and guide them through the following stages depending on what the client is looking for out of a suitable candidate. Um And then hopefully the end result will be that will place them in a suitable job and that will keep not only the candidate happy but the client happy at the same time. Um Now because I'm responsible for managing quite serious projects on some occasions they do give me more work, more responsibility, which is great for me and great for business, but on these occasions it does require me requiring additional hands, additional help. So I work with a small team um Now a lot of the time we work together on some projects that are bigger but there are some occasions where I need to borrow a member of staff to help me with my projects um if they're quite important. Um So because of this I'll be responsible for training um these staff members um managing them um so that I can ensure that they are capable of being able to follow through with the same processes as me and help out within the project. Um So because of this I'm quite comfortable and also confident um with the leadership leadership aspect because I I'm quite used to being able to teach other members of staff and train them on different areas of projects that I'm working on um as well as managing them um and their workloads, so prioritizing what they should be doing um and then also helping them if they get stuck or they they need me to reassess the responsibilities that have given them. Maybe there are some areas that maybe they struggle with that might be more useful given to someone else. Um So a lot of it is based on myself and how I manage the workload as well as the individuals who are working for me on a certain project, so I definitely possess the skills to be able to take it further onto a more senior role. Um I also have four plus years experience within the industry within the same company as well. Um So I've worked all different aspects of the role, so my knowledge is quite good at this point, I definitely know what I'm doing within the recruitment industry, I definitely know how to train staff members, motivate staff members. Um I know how to dictate tasks easily to different individuals. Um So yeah, I'm very familiar with the whole process um and very much want to move forward in my career um to a more senior title to be able to take on that little bit more responsibility um and expand on the current skills um and knowledge that you already possess within this industry.",NEUTRAL,0.3654,0.0035,0.6306,0.0005,724.0,MED,7,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),7.65,1,0,0,"Associate degree (e.g. AA, AS)",Female,8.738489,8.466547,8.906781

Like you know, understanding each individual's um weaknesses and strengths and not being a helicopter and micromanaging the things they do and letting them do their own thing knowing that they can come to me if they're stuck on something or they can rely on other team members to help them out. So I think that's really important to me for the team to feel like they are trusted by me and they can do the work that's been dedicated, dedicated, delegated to them and you know, not feel micromanaged by me. Another important quality that I have is my willingness to listen. And I think that goes hand in hand with me being an empath. You know, whether it be like a personal problem, a work problem or um um internal problems within the team. I'm always linked to listen t um the members and um each person, you know, because I value, I value they I need them to feel um important and understood and like valued that goes a very long way. You know, and I'm I'm always want to put myself in a person's situation and and you know just empathize with them. So that is very important to me to be willing to listen to my fellow um to my fellow members of the team and um honestly like I'm very honest with my team on like, um, the deadlines we need to meet when we need to meet them and what's expected of us. You know, I'm not going to use, um, manipulation tactics or lie or cheat to get my way. I'm honest with my team about what I expect from them and what they should expect from me too and what's expected from us from an upper level. So, you know, an environment of honesty, like, um, you know, it's something I really, really, really think it's important because um, it just makes, it just makes for a while oiled machine. We're honest. We trust, trust each other and it's just, it's just a, it's a, it's a, it's a beautiful thing.

That is that I said for you and um, yes, I think that is really, really, really important. Um, another thing I really value in my team is critical thinking, just not saying anything at, um levels are level level surface, you know, like let's take all elements and think about this critically and um, you know, think about how we can use it in the future. You know, think about all the things we've learned, put it together and think about what we can get out of this, how we can maximize the company's profit.

Um I have also, as a PhD student, been in charge of managing lots of small groups of undergraduates, so um in my field of science we do a lot of lab work and demonstrating and I've been in charge of um kind of demonstrating different practical techniques in the lab to undergraduates. Um I've also managed smaller groups in the lab and kind of been there um leader and they're sort of like um I'm trying to think of the best way to describe this like their supervisor, I wasn't their direct supervisor, of course, I was, you know, underneath my, my PhD supervisor, but um I was the one that they would go to if they had any questions or if they were struggling in there and whether it be something to do with actually practical work or working in the statistical software that we use is quite complicated and I was very experienced in that and they would come and ask for for help with if they needed it. And I got great reviews at the end of that semester, So, and they had a good time and my um my supervisor above me had said that I had done a very good job. So there's another kind of example of me developing leadership skills, acting as a kind of point of reference for a small group of individuals, which is basically what managing a team is. And I helped them create kind of a timeline of their studies and how best to tackle their both the practical work, their analysis and then they're right up within the time frame that they were given as well, which is a very important skill for a kind of team leader and a team to have another thing that I do quite often as I work in schools with high school students and kind of college age students and I run um kind of classes and to to teach them about the field I work in his biology. So it's to kind of teach them about different aspects of biology that they might not be familiar with and particularly my specific area and then they have to go away and then write an S. E. And then bring it back to me and then I market and give them a grade based on that. Um And I am their point of reference if they have any questions about the specific topic we've covered or um anything about the course in general that we're doing or if they have questions about going on to study at university and the point of contact for that. And I've run that pretty much since the beginning of my PhD. So that's three years and that's twice a year pixel each semester. So I've ran it six times and I have had really good feedback from the pupils. They really enjoy the courses that I designed for them and they're all very keen to go on to study at university afterwards.

But I did want a photographic lab back in the day where everyone had told them and such and as such I had to have a strong time management skills because we did offer in our service and photographs. So you have to be very careful about time and managing staff where they were don't break. You all have to deal with a lot of handling how to deal customers and bleeding people how to build customer splendor. Where problems as Jeffrey where machines were very easily break and people would come back actually book brush dr bruner and up Most of the education people get angry. So we would have to work on that and manage how people we'll talk to people. So I'd have to lead people about how to do that. Um I think having people know how to deal with customers isn't always an actual Yeah. So sometimes that you would have this down at the top, you have to do such things also you'd have to teach people a lot of different types quickly as different change came in. Under the age of digital cameras have to start it off which 0.5 months. Especially some of the older staff wouldn't have been here to see you computers or any sort of Children. Right? Yeah. This would have been around 2003 to 2005. So there would have been a lot of taking a lot of time and teaching people and talking people who might necessarily being comfortable with such things at Children helps done, put them on different forces at have to this one was a little bit too hard to learn and you would have to find a way to let them know that they were struggling that what without in any way starting price and maybe it's just me Carson them that they could do for free, they might be happy about that to him to their staff members to do their part. But they would, if you spoke to my feet about an opportunity they would usually be happy to do it and you could achieve everyone being, we had a number of occasions where the company might cut hours or change people's hours and that will be very problematic. Mhm. But perhaps kids in school and routine, so that was few different problems that navigate in a leadership role. So I think a few of those skills would be people management, time management and of course then with the other aspect of having to deal with other companies, particularly if it came to we had a lot of chemicals, different kinds of papers, kinds of machines. So we have a lot of different companies that we would have to touch base with and sometimes they would personally and I haven't stopped because this or that you have to get into the other branches for company and negotiate baby them sending it over chemicals and paper. So there was definitely the task manager leadership aspect of having to touch base with different different different department test and the company and always building relationships with those people in the best way possible. So that if you had a problem they would feel inclined to help you and obvious communicate well and be nice to them and share change back and forth with thousands if they needed help always be there to help other other branches of the company or new company came in wraps came in on a tiered mouth because even though you might think it's something that's going to be taking on your company, you never know next big thing to give back then as I started to this ledge came in camera was you never knew what was going to be the next big thing and what would take and what wouldn't take what sticks and what wouldn't stick. So that was another aspect of leadership was he said that was a few years ago but I think that was the skills translated. I'm I can direct a very helpful to have I think now on how to speak to people when to speak to people and how do just be good at your job for him or for it's very useful in a leadership role. So that's that would be the skills. But I feel personally help me natural. I think people skills are the strongest for leadership and then everything else comes into play.

My name is Ray Shelter Lower, and I am interviewing for a manager for a small art studio, something that is often required but never often fulfilled. It's a dream of many, many artists. Uh, first and foremost, I think there's this common, um, idea that yeah, artists are very focused on their craft and not so much the office aspect. And I'd like to dispel that myth. I think it's really important to chunk your day out into different tasks, Um, and also things like money management, um, different sort of supply management's shipping. All of those things are really important for artists. Uh, my biggest skill set in that real house that realm is, Um uh huh. Managing schedules, blocking out chunks of time through the day. Um, and also just scheduling weeks and months ahead, different commissions and that sort of thing. I think it's really relevant and important to have an idea of what you want to bring as far as income in a month and then sourcing out finding commissions, that sort of thing to bring in that amount of money that you're going for. Um, so in that respect, social media is also really important reaching out to customers past and present. Um, difference. Sort of, um, come different ideas of commissions. I mean, there's all sorts of projects you could be working on, whether it was just a painting in itself, or is it part of a set design, or is it part of an office space? So there's a lot of moving parts as far as, um, you think of an artist and you think painting. But there is many, many complex parts of an aspects of being an artist. I had said earlier that, um, my strongest songs strongest aspect of the business aspect of art is chunking out time making, um, setting goals and chunking out that time specific for, um, your month, your week, whatever you're aiming for. So I like to kind of do block time, block chunks through my day. I'm also a mom, so I'm having to kind of mhm, um, block out time for school pick ups and things like that. I think it's really an important and underutilized aspect. Um, is that block timing as well as another thing that we really magnificent to have a manager for would be for, um, billing quoting that sort of thing. Um, obviously, it's a pretty straightforward framework of materials used in time, but and there's some other, more complex aspects things like careers and shipping that can always be a little bit difficult. Um, and that's something that I've really sort of stepped into and accepted. It's not a fun part of the job, but it's necessary. Um, other complex things about billing are just things you would never consider that you need to pay for. So that would be like business insurance. Um, social media like, um, website design. All of those things can be pretty complicated. So it would be beautiful to have the opportunity to share my knowledge of these things with a fellow artist or become some sort of manager in that respect. Uh, yeah, just I think that the idea of being a manager for this sort of profession is under utilized and very, very, very much necessary.

I'm currently doing a project masters masters degree, a project management master's degree which were um which is where I hone in on my people management and project management skills um that I hope to be able to transfer into my job and into the actual industry itself.

I'm managing different subcontractors at any one time, um Different skills and leadership therefore come with the role that I'm currently doing. Um and that will be transferrable in my next role.

Um I think a 30, 60, 90 day plan is always great when you come in as a new manager. Again, 30 days to get to know your staff 60 days to um Get feedback from them. What could be improved? What do they see if they've been here longer? Um what do they see as needs to be improved right away? And then within 90 days, how can we make those changes happen? How can we do that as a team? And again, it's all about building team, we are all in this together and again, that means that um leading by example, being here late, when, when others are working late? Um, being here on a weekend, when others need to work on a weekend, it is having the same amount of commitment to the overall vision that each person has. And I think that um that goes into, you know, prioritizing personal development, developing others um innovation and action. Um and then uh I think that we we need to stay in a place where um we we are we are looking at cross cultural communication, diversity equity and inclusion. How can we um bring that into an office and how can we bring that into our organization and into our overall vision? Um If given the opportunity, I would uh love to come in, meet your staff, see, see what your vision is, and to see how that aligns with my overall vision. Again, I think that work can also be pleasure and it is finding out how to create that space for staff so that they can find the same pleasure I do in in coming into work on a daily basis, being challenged on a daily basis. Um mixing things up, never letting things be boring. And again, it's all about feedback, you know, allowing them the space to let me know what went well, what didn't go well. Um and how can we make improvements? Right, it's not a one way street and again, finding out what kind of management, uh what kind of feedback do they want, You know, do they want somebody who is, is micromanaging or do they",POSITIVE,0.6641,0.0011,0.3336,0.0012,770.0,LOW,3,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),37.22,1,0,0,"Bachelor's degree (e.g. BA, BS)",Female,8.939859,8.664108,8.579307

And so I do believe I could be called manager position roll. Um, I've been shopping for six years with the operator experience anywhere. Um, I have dealt with a lot of challenging situations with both employees and customers. Mm as this is a job role in customer services. Mcdonald's. Um, you wouldn't trust me both customers and employees. So therefore you need to be able to communicate independently. Being able to work things out yourself rather than just flying out of it at the same time. You have to be able to workaround of us. I've got communication skills, teamwork and I've had a lot of experience like 36 years. So I do believe that I personally not how to get all these things and I think the best, the best way to go about it is you have to, you have to be emperor. Emphatic. You have to be able to put yourself in the customer's shoes. Even if you feel angry are you doing? I don't agree with what the scene. You need to be able to put them first. They've got the issue and the other one is open on there. See you as it's won the right to deliver good service. So that's what you need to do. And so I do feel like I can do that. I feel like I'm approachable play, you know, a lot of speaking customers and one of the fingers, my tendencies grab. Thanks past six years. I've been coming. Donald, I've, I'd only like a harmful days off just for being hill from being elsewhere. Things. I just can't help and I'm always on time. You know, make sure is any traffic, I'll get up earlier. Won't leave things to the last minute because also that ends up, we've been let that affects the floor. You know, there's a plan for where every employee needs to go and get that one person is like, it messes up so it's important that you take that into consideration. And, and the reason why I feel like I could be a good idea here is that I have a good balance of being friendly to my employees. But also norman you need to take leadership. You know, give him an order sir, look, come calm down some of your work. So I have no life. But you need to be able to tell people off, even if they're your friends are like communities, You go off and get your, your, your job. You know, you have to put that bones between, you know, friendship on book. Yeah. And another reason I feel like it could be a good manager is um, take things so serious, you know, and you don't get anything done, stood around laughing joking. You know, you need to be serious when you're working with with his money as well. So I'll just say if I have to count the money, do the kind of policy check labor. So when you're dealing with that is not messing around. You know, if you make one mistake, you're not thinking straight, that's it. Money is lost in the night. You've also feel like all these things up you're gonna has more activity. You have to know what you're doing. Yeah, I feel hot. You know, you need to look in a bit of monday's, you need them to rely on you, they are relying on you to look after the, the money and to sort out any problems, complaints and feeling like that. How do you feel like you could do that? A lot of people think Mcdonald's is just need a job. You know, it's flipping burgers and cooking but it's definitely not as manageable. My job would be to, I would have to supervise all my employees. I would have to send their much on, you know, even if it is going to be so wrong, speed them up and if you need help our jumping up so I need to be trained on all the areas. So tills drive for a kitchen come jumping out funny too. But model bitter supervised overall thing, check everything's going right. It does any serious customer went all day without, you know, got professional. Sometimes I said you don't agree, but sometimes offering them, you know free food a refund. It's knowing about knowing when to do that or what, but given what options, suicide the best situation. Um, so yeah, I do feel like a lot of the skills, I've got a booking movers constantly. So I was wearing people and I want to communicate, I can deal with challenging situations. I'm still learning every single day where I've been there six years and I'm still learning things, which that's what I love. I love learning new things. I'd like to take on new challenges.

Yeah, I'm going to be applying for this manager's position at this company. And first of all, I'd like to start off by saying, thank you for giving me this opportunity to be able to apply the manager. Um, I have had previous experience in managing. I was the three I see third in charge at a previous company, and now I've stepped back as a part timer because I study full time. Um, that was one of the most rewarding experiences I've had in my life, and I'm only I'm very young, but I'd like to say, because I've had this experience, it has. I have experience, and I have knowledge on what to do in and managing role saying that I'm very hard working person and a quick learner. Um, I, Um I always make sure I put 120% into everything that I do whether that study or work or anything. I try really, really hard to make sure that all the work that I produce is of a very high standard. Um, a fast learner. I picked up this role, My previous role as three. I see very quickly, and I basically had to learn all the skills and everything that was required of me within 23 days. And then I had to start running days and start working at this retail job of managing a team of around 10 11 girls a day. Um, which was a lot, but it was a very, very valuable learning experience. Um, during my time working at the my previous company, I have found that I am a very effective communicator. I was basically a mediator between a messenger between head office, higher management, which would be my essay, my assistant manager and the manager and all the other employees, which include worker and charges, um, the fourth in charge, the any full timers, part timers, casual workers, especially over the Christmas period. We had so many workers in and out we we had to make sure that everyone was happy. And I really find it really, really important that you have to communicate with everyone and see how they're doing if they like where the company is going there, like where the story's going, if they want to change in direction if they need more direction. Um, I think that's very important in building. That team community is very important, and communication is at the root of all of that. And yeah, having someone being there to be able to communicate between everyone is super important to building very strong connections between everyone, your team and that makes your team stronger and runs like a well oiled machine. Everything just goes way more smoothly and everyone is happy, which is very, very important. I'm definitely a people person. I really, really enjoy talking to everyone. And I really enjoy forming relationships with my coworkers, um, managers and again, just making sure that everyone is okay and happy with the working environment work environment. And if not, then how we could change this. And, um, right everyone's experience better. I I am a very good and very good at time managing. I am a student and I'm working part time. So being able to work and study at the same time has taught me how to prioritize. And those skills transfer into my managing style Feel like prioritizing is another one of those things that you have to learn. Um, Japan's one person to person you can learn very quickly, very slowly, but I feel like because I've had that experience. It's very valuable. You can't do everything at once, and some things are more urgent than others. And it's very it takes time in scale to be able to see what you should be doing first and what would be the most logical way of doing something. And I feel like having this experience of being a third in charge and having to prioritize is very valuable as a manager, um, and being able to delegate because not everyone can delegate, Um, it's quite difficult. I do struggle, sometimes being able to delegate and make just trusting of the story. But the more you do it, the easier it gets. And I've had to do it a lot because you can't you just can't do everything yourself. And it's It's one of the most beneficial skills I've learned from being in a management role. Um, I am very flexible as well, and, um, yeah, delegating flexibility. I think all these things intertwine and make someone a very good manager, and I would love to be considered for this role if possible.

You always need to be patient because when you're patient, you can actually see your job that you've been assigned through, you can you find it easy to deal with people because I mean we all have our differences and because we're all very different, it's important that your patient because when your patient you get to understand where the other person is coming from and try to just see how best you can use these differences to enhance or improve or just arrive at your desired goal or even achieve more than you expect because it's not just based on your opinions or your views of things, but you're seeing what another person is saying and you're trying to put all that together and make sure that the job that you've been assigned, you actually achieve it. Another thing is that I'm a great team player because with patients comes if you're a patient person but you don't know how to work with different people, then I feel like that might be a problem. And because this position deals with like deals with interacting with people, I'm a great team player because I know that we're all different and with our differences, we can actually still achieve things. It might not necessarily be the way that I might want it to be. But taking these differences that exist between us as individuals, I'm just finding a way to make it work to achieve what it is that we all want or we've all been assigned to do.

Um I honestly don't have a lot of opinions, experience with leadership. Um I don't like to have control over people. I'm not bossy for domineering by nature, but you know that might be what makes me a good manager and a good leader because I'm not interested in just wielding power for the sake of having power. Um I'm interested in diplomacy, fairness, equality. Um I feel like I would be the kind of person that would listen to an employee's problems or concerns before making decisions. I feel that I would be sensitive to people's needs and emotions. Um And I think not wanting to be a leader and by that, I mean not necessarily not being ambitious but not wanting control or power just for the sake of having control or power. Like some people their whole goal is to get into management because they just want to be in charge. Um Not because they want to make the company a better place or because they want to help their employees succeed and thrive. So not being interested in leadership in this sense of I don't want to control other people doesn't mean that I don't want to guide other people. Um I think that's a fine line between guidance and control that um is overlooked a lot of the time. Um So I think in terms of that I would be inclined to you know, just listen and use the skills I have as an employee to understand employees because I think also a lot of managers have forgotten what it's like to be a frontline employee. Um the work life balance, that trying to please your bosses and get ahead and build your own reputation in the company. I mean a lot of managers aren't even thinking on those terms anymore, so I think I would still be connected to the everyday needs of the average employee and I think I could be sensitive to those concerns. Um And again I think real leadership is in guidance, not control and I think that I would try my best to be a good guide, a good mentor, um a positive influence at work and not just someone that people are afraid of or that people feel pressured to please. Um So yeah, I mean while I don't have a lot of experience managing other people, I have a lot of experience and being managed. And I read something recently that really resonated with me and it was that um employees don't quit jobs, they quit managers. So and I've I've been in that position where I quit a job that I otherwise enjoyed. The job was good at the job, but I could not work With an unreasonable manager 1 2nd longer. It just wasn't worth it. There is no amount of money, they can make it ok to work for someone who degrades you debases, you manipulate you so I would not want to be that kind of manager and I think honestly, maybe the more experience you have being a manager, the more inclined you ought to be that kind of manager. So yeah, you know, I don't know how convincing this was. I hate how I look on video. But um yeah, I think not wanting to be a manager would make me a good manager because I don't want to dominate other people. I want to lift other people up.

Um So I'm going to talk about my leadership skills and abilities and experience. Um My current role at the moment is a senior stroke neuro rehab physiotherapist within the NHS um While I'm not specifically in charge of our actual neuro team, I do sort of sub manage our team of therapists on the ward Um and that team comprises of student physiotherapy assistants, band five or junior physios, less experienced senior physiotherapists. Um Also occupational therapists, speech therapists as well in that mix a range of disciplines. And so I am responsible for the management of our caseload on a day to day basis, looking at our patient's treatment, plans goals progressions from admission to discharge and I have to delegate tasks each day as to which therapist is going to see that patient, making sure that that patient is on track to moving towards getting home or out of hospital. However, that might look. um I must also make sure that that each patient has enough therapy each day to meet their 45 minutes of of therapy as there are Royal College of Physicians straight guidelines. So that's important with time management. I attend handover meetings in the mornings to discuss with senior staff at the hospital um sort of where our patients are in terms of discharge planning to assist with patient flow through the hospital, which basically means sort of getting people in the door onto the wards treated and then back out of the hospital again, make sure there's no hold ups and I also attend straight update meetings with patients, families, relatives, friends to provide updates and again to sort of keep them up to date with how they're progress is an indirect part of my roll from a leadership perspective is conflict resolution and managing expectations, which is quite important in our line of work. It can be quite emotive and family members and patients who have just been through a really traumatic time, be displaying a range of emotions. So being able to manage that and read the situation and um be responsive to that, which I think is a really good skill and a leader and also working with my colleagues if they've got what's the word recommendations from each are about their ways of working. So whether they just only do a couple of hours and then they need a rest or they only work short days, then I need to factor that in to my planning in the morning as to how I'm delegating my staff on occasion at work. I have stepped up and the absence of our team leader to assist with like voters and people management and also service development and how we are progressing our service, improving our service and the quality of care we give to our patients, my training courses and um sort of qualifications that I feel make me a good um candidate for this role from leadership point of view. I've done leadership courses, conflict resolution courses, communication courses, all of these things. I think just each time develop my skills. Um and I also am involved actually in training at work for delivering that training to colleagues to improve all of our lives um outside of work as well. I've held a number of leadership roles in a voluntary capacity, so I've been the voluntary chairman of a lifesaving team while ourselves at university, which basically oversaw the whole running of the club, recruiting new members, managing memberships and sorting out training and having training providers and go into competitions and things like that. So really just overseeing the whole thing and again, delegating to staff, not staff, delegating to other volunteers who were on the committee. And I've also been the Competition secretary for our local Lifesaving club, again, quite similar, but mainly just focusing on the competition side, arranging competitions, running them, attending them, making sure that we've got teams to attend. More recently, a treasurer for a preschool um involved in wages and bookkeeping. Um and furthermore at home, my mother to three boys, so I manage a household appointments, finances, homework, schoolwork, social activities, again, managing conflicts at home. So I'm a team player.

We try to meet up, I'd like to meet up with my team and try to make a clear vision and communicate with them or what is our task for the day and for our monthly tasks so that we can reach our goals along with that. I like to set clear expectations and have them to set also goals among themselves to make a challenge within themselves and with myself as well in order to be able to achieve these goals with my team. And always, you know, I'm always trying to be very communicative with them and trying to see what methods will be um more useful for as a team and even as individually. So that's why we always have these meetings as well weekly so that we can try to meet these visions that we have and you know providing feedback from both sides. It's not just a one way of meat telling them of how things should be done, it's also them giving me feedback on how to improve my own work and also just coaching all around with team and obviously caring about my team, I care so much about the team. I really want to make sure that we have a healthy competitive work environment that we do not become this toxicity within each other. Okay and some of the personal experiences I have really is managing a team has been through several call centers, being as a supervisor in these to set these goals that we had of making numbers and making and completing those goals and then also rewarding our team after doing such a great effort and you know just making it a fun game like I said yes creating a competitive work environment but also making it in a healthy manner and also just helping to foster team development which will help us to improve as a team And not only that makes great numbers for the company which then you know it's just it's a reciprocal way basically and just you know do good and it's just going to keep like good will go back and we also and like I said with these meetings that we have we value so much of employees perspective that we will home. We want to know what areas can we improve, what areas can I improve it in what areas I can help to improve their abilities as a as a as an employee as well.

I think that communication in writing, whether it be a professional letter or an email um or you know, obviously verbal communication, visual communication, body language. These are all things that I really base a lot of importance on and consideration any time I'm communicating with people like I said, whether it's verbally or in writing an email to a team disseminating information to the organization. It's really important to me to take the time to consider how that communication could be perceived understood by various people.

If I'm not passionate then my team is not gonna be passionate. If I do not have the energy then it's just gonna drain the rest of my team members. So I feel like motivation is very, very important.

So if um I am not ahead of the game, then my team is not going to be ahead of the game and that means the work is not going to be efficient as as efficient as it should be. So um I need to have not only a week's plan but a month plan so that my team knows what is expected for them not only for the week but for the whole month and that we look at the bigger picture.

If there's people who are more mathematical or into numbers, I need to focus on their strengths and not their weaknesses. Problem solving and decision making is also very important because I believe that um problems will occur and therefore you need to be very self aware and you also need to be aware of your environment and your team members because it will make it easier for you to solve certain problems. Um decision making is also based on being aware of your environment and seeing what goes together and what doesn't. Um commercial awareness is is very vital because you need to be aware of the community is surrounded by social media, the internet, this will all um or work together because then you will be able to make better decisions and you'll be able to solve things quickly because you are aware of the marketplace that you're in.

I have previously done this um with working in my own laboratory with students um not only in the masters of biotechnology program but then also students who are summer interns at the Pharmacy of College and both uh categories of students were able to learn and grow their knowledge so they could have experience in lab procedures and actually understand um at the end of their time in the lab what they were doing and why they were doing it and the technique and the explanations as to why we do these techniques and they were able to then apply that to their general coursework in their respective programs. I was I was also able to do this when I was a teaching assistant. So I was able to not only share and demonstrate my knowledge but then also have these students ask me questions and I was able to lead a group of 20-25 students at one time and they were able then to um increase their knowledge so that they can move on with their studies. And another reason I am fit for this role is because I am naturally leaning towards leadership opportunities, but I also have found that I enjoy hearing other thoughts and contributions. So it was a vigorous member elected process. I ended up being elected for the judicial chair of my um membership to a program. And this, this was with and not only ensuring that each rules are fit, but then also um having a liaison between different members of the group to self issues that may come about. Um and with this membership roll, it lasted for a year, I was able to not only set meetings between different members but to the whole um organization at one time, not only to update them on any ongoing issues that needed to be addressed, um, but then also introducing new rules, new concepts for the club for itself, and then also relaying those messages back from the, from the numbers to the executive board numbers and also then uh, to the mentors for the club and between um Being able to manage those communications between multiple different sets of people were able to accomplish a lot of tasks. And then also um make sure that communication was where it needed to be because in a group of 50 plus people it can be very hard and very confusing sometimes to manage all that. There could also be a lot of feelings that arise. So too tame a lot of different personalities. I was able to use my leadership techniques of communicating and listening, active listening um between those different groups of people so that we're able to actually get things done and be productive with the small amount of time we did have outside of other class studies.

And I think one of my greatest skills is the ability to be able to listen to people and not judge what they are saying and listen to them and they suddenly, clearly and in giving the relevant advice, we it's cute and I believe that I am able I'm a team player, I'm able to work with people and I am able to sit down get different opportunity or opinions of what people think, and I can also be a team player. Not everything that I say as a manager is important. Obviously I would have to take the people that I work with spectating into into into into consideration. And I I think another thing that will make me great as a manager that I am able to sit down with the people that I'm working with, b at the same level as them and communicate with them and not be that's straight because obviously if you come across to people as being straight, you're not able to work with them because they are not able to come forth to you because you are not an approachable person. So I think as a manager, one of my greatest skills is that I'm very approachable and like I said before obviously if you are approachable people can come to you talk to you with whatever problems that they have and I believe that as a manager you should not always think that what you say should go or you are always right, you need to take other people into account. And obviously one of the greatest values of being a manager is obviously being able to work with people, being able to listen to people and that's one of the skills that I believe that I have and also you need to be on time. I can be on time. I'm always efficient because I need to set an example to the people that I work with and the people that I'm leading. So time, very important tasks that I do believe that if I am given a deadline uh the deadline, I need to respect the time and the deadline that I'm given so that the people that I work with also know in respect time and respect deadlines cause as a leader you always have to lead by example you cannot expect people to deliver task on time and be at work on time whereas you cannot do the same thing. So you always have to be efficient on time. Task deadlines you need to be set and they need to be done at a certain time. So those are the one of the qualities that I believe that I have. And also I believe that people can come talk to me, sit down very approachable person and I can always always have an ear to listen. So I always think that as a manager I'll have an open door policy so that everybody that I work with is able to come down if they have anything important or they think they have a better plan on how we can do things always willing to listen to the people because I believe that those are the greatest quality that you can have as a manager.

Start task over a few details of why I think I am worthy candidate. And so I'll start off with saying that I believe I can demonstrate the relevant leadership skills for this rule. Um I have been I have had experience of leadership For almost 10 years and I run my own brownies group which I've done for a lot of years and over the years I have develop the skills necessary. For example I have good flexibility, creativity and good negotiation negotiation skills. I've also got good time management and I can work well as a team as well as working individually which I think is really important in a role like a manager's position because I think that you do need to have both the skills to work independently and work with others as well. I can delegate responsibilities efficiently as well. So using the example of my team, I have a team of three of us and I'm the main leader, I've got an assistant leader and a unit leader and I can delegate the tasks every week really well when the team's feeling happy about it and if they've got any concerns they can come to me and say they're not happy with what they want to do. Can I do something else? And again that's fine, I can take criticism really well and I think that's really important as well to take criticism really well because then you can learn from what you can improve on and you can take it on board. Um yes, I'm also really good at problem solving. So again, I'll use an example, there was a time where quite serious problems did occur in my team and I was able to plan a meeting with the team, we sat all down together and we were able to talk through, communicate really well about what happened and how we go about resolving the issue and everybody came out of the meeting feeling positive about how it went and I believe that was down to how I what the a purse that had taken basically. Um and as well as a leader, I think it's important to recognize the good things of your team and recognize them and make sure that you do say when somebody is doing really well, I think it's important to say when you're doing something that you need to improve on as well. Um and I think it's important to communicate that really well instead of going the wrong way about it, if that makes sense. Um I can motivate a team really well and if somebody is feeling down, I can give a lot of positivity in the group and I think that is really important as opposed to her in the negative leader. I think people want to approach that person, I think my personality is very positive and not be anyway, so I do think that does make a difference because again, I had an example where worked with somebody who was very negative and they didn't give any feedback about what I was doing and I didn't really want to be there. But if you were around someone that's happy and positive, you know, they really help you. I think that does make a big difference. Yeah. I think given all these points, I do think that I am a good candidate for the role and hope to hear from museum.

So the first thing I need to tell you is that I'm very knowledgeable in my field, I'm not just knowledgeable. I have a passion, which means that I do a lot of research of my own back. Um so you'll find me talking about things that you might not even have heard of yourself because I'm always on the ball, I've got my finger on that pulse, I just find it interesting. So I think that's probably one of the things that I can bring to my position is that I will always innovate because of my passion for the, the field that I work within. Um so that's the first thing I have to say the second thing and I think this is really important that a leader should have it is that I am personable, I love talking to people, I like making friends. I'm never going to be the kind of person that does things in an underhand way. I will be straightforward, I will be kind and supportive because unfortunately a lot of us have worked under leaders who I don't have those interpersonal skills and I feel that that makes it a lot more difficult to work as part of a team. Um Speaking of teams, you know, I'm a I'm a team player, I really like to get the most out of my team members. I don't feel threatened by other people's skills, I feel like they need to have their chance to shine and that those skills should be used to make the entire project better. So what I will do is I will find out what those skills are, I will find out what people's passions are and I will help them to use those things um in order to get better results. So what about finding and harnessing the talents of my coworkers? Um I think the other thing that would make me a good leader is that I do like to make decisions quickly. I like I hate to be bored or slow at work. I like everything to be kind of nonstop. I like a dynamic working environment, so I think about that will make me into a into a great leader, you know, I like to make those quick decisions. Um I like to, I feel like the environment that I'm working is constantly challenging and I'm ready to rise to those challenges. Um one thing that I think that I will bring as well is that while those decisions might be made quickly when necessary, I like to use a very logical, coherent kind of workflow when I do make decisions, I tend to use all kinds of visual aids, I like flow charts, I like pros and cons and I'm just using all of those different kinds of um systems to come to the best possible decision for my work group. Um so for that reason I feel like I will be a trustworthy, honest person who will make decisions in a logical way. Um Also I think it's really important as a leader two be able to accept criticism, I'm not going to be a dictator as it were. I would be someone who would be willing and able to take on the opinions of my other skilled colleagues. Um and I think that that's one thing required of a good leader. You know, it's not everything needs to be top down, we need to work as a team and as I say utilize those skills. So you know, while I'm making those decisions and using my favorite methods of decision making, I will also be asking my coworkers for their opinions bearing in mind though that as a leader, I will be able to take those difficult decisions when it is necessary, you know, and when it comes to difficult things. I mean, you know during covid, during the covid pandemic, I have had to make a lot of difficult decisions uh you know regarding different ways of working, communicate those effectively to my colleagues and that is something I have excelled in and will continue to excel in. So yeah, as a leader, I am sure you will be happy with your choice if you pick me for a leadership position.

I was able to work on various projects now. What I then come by bringing to the table is my expertise in public speaking in management, in administration and of course project leading, so it is not even a difficult adjustment for me to be able to place myself in a place where I can be able to lead a team in position of project managing. I am, Oh I have knowledge which is vast in terms of having worked with over 10 projects, micro and macro projects, government projects and also projects that are in the private sector. One thing that I have learned about managing is the ability of the skill of listening, the skill as well of being able to take construction and to be able to do everything in accordance or other time management. Now to be able to be an effective leader, you have to have the skill of listening and be able to solve problems. Now, problem solving back in the day used to be a course which was a prerequisite in many schools, but now it's kind of something that the person has to make along the way around. I discover in books and leadership books, which I'm also quite a keen fan of, I read um quite a lot of an avid reader. I am someone who keeps up as much as possible with news. Um also someone who keeps up with the ever changing climate of project management and I'm able to also adapt because another thing about our kind of industry is that you find that not every project that was saying, especially as we enter into the fourth industrial revolution just before I are, we find that in our country in South Africa, rather we are um edging towards the four R, which means that we are learning so much more about how to integrate everything into more digital work, more computer based work more um as an artificial Excuse me, intelligence. So what I do enjoy is that this is um an absolutely amazing opportunity to grow. What I enjoy is growth. What I enjoy is expansion. What I enjoy of course is also the opportunity of traveling because in project management you're not stuck or redundant or glued to a desk, but you also get the opportunity of the outside you get the opportunity of traveling, meeting people, client lies in and relationship management and building, which is also one of my key expertise. I absolutely enjoy every single thing that I do and I I do hope that in whatever is the consideration we together can be able to work as a team and be able to edge forward this company, this brand and be able to curve it into something that is amazing. So why would I be an amazing candidate for a project managing position? I absolutely believe in work ethic, I believe in putting in the hours, I believe in self development, mental health, which is an absolutely amazing thing to keep in mind, my mental health, the mental health of the team very important. And also the overall image of the company which is in support of mental health, in support of non toxic work environment and also the ability of supporting, I guess in education, education is absolutely important. As I've highlighted, the significance of being someone who um is educated is, you know, have qualifications and also someone who still continues to really expand as someone who has multiple degrees. I enjoy studying, enjoy learning and I can only hope that this kind of position, this is my fit and hope that the company would enjoy having me as a part.

Um I have many leadership skills that I've learned through various roles and I have worked as a senior nurse managing patients with complex conditions and doing working at every little center where I had to manage patients by phone for with complex conditions that live many miles away. I have to learn to be assertive to complete my role, to get patients to be concise, to use my time efficiently, have excellent communication skills to work with people from many different teams and many different roles, many different facets of health care and have a fantastic communication skills. I understand the importance of communicating with people from different ethnic backgrounds from different socioeconomic backgrounds, how people communicate differently, have different values and the way they communicate. Now this is absolutely key to helping and make sure people understand um what I need from them and what I expect from them in a supportive and caring environment. So people feel enabled and empowered to work well and to communicate with other people in their team. I also um a mother of three. Um and I have learned a lot about time management and working with in unpredictable situations where you don't always have control of the um the situation itself and you have to be quick to change, quick to bend quick to adapt to the situation that's going on around you. And I think it's a fantastic transferrable skill to any workplace situation where you can have a very rapid, fast changing situations and to be able to adapt and change your methods of working quickly depending on who you're working with and what situation arises and other skills, I have to think maybe a good leader, I have strong convictions. I'm happy to speak the truth to people even when it can be painful, because I think authenticity and speaking truthfully is incredibly important. I think it's unhelpful to not speak honestly. I think it's unhelpful to being authentic and or be passive aggressive because I don't think it helps environments thrive. I don't think it helps workplaces thrive and I'm very happy to in kind and compassionate ways to speak honestly and directly to people, which I think is essential as a manager who needs to be able to get the most from their team, make sure their team morale is high and make sure we can communicate with each other well feeling supported, but I feel they can speak honestly and people can talk about problems that are going on and move forward rather than workplaces dwelling in old mistakes or all problems and that can disrupt people's productivity. Um other things. I think that would make me a good leader would be that I am. Thank you, I arrive on time. I am hard worker. I um understand the value of time how it has to be used well how when it's about working smarter and not harder that working very hard in inefficient ways is not a good use of time. Whereas finding systems that work well that reduce workloads for people they can do the things they're more gifted in rather than getting bogged down in paperwork administration that may not be the skill set they have or doesn't use the skills that they have most efficiently and waste valuable skills that companies need to keep companies thriving and growing really well. And I also am able to spot gifting in people. I think it helped bring them out of them. I'm good at empowering people, helping them see who they are, see how they can do better and help them reach that through good communication and empowerment through helping them overcome some of the challenges they may face things that they find hard, helping people understand that we can always grow, we can always do better. We can always move forward and by honest and authentic communication, I think I can help people and my grasp on to and the better version of themselves that they can rise above who they currently are and what they currently do or any of the things that they find hard and can do better.

Um what I find is one of my main qualities that allows me to be a leader is the ability to listen but actively participate when needed. And so I think like when it comes to professional development days or when it comes to working collaboratively, it's really important to listen to the ideas that are being presented, really take those into consideration and give feedback and criticism that enables all of you to work to the best of your ability. So cooperation and listening skills are two of the main areas that I feel allow me to be an effective leader, another trait that I have that allows me to be an effective leader is the ability to take control and take the lead when necessary, but also being willing to be a team player and I think that that's a huge responsibility when it comes to management is that you can take the lead if the others in your team need a bit of help or need some support, but also the ability to know when to step down and when to take a step back. I think a lot of the times people have one or the other where they're able to lead or they're able to kind of take that back seat, but for me, I feel like I have the ability to do both and I enjoy doing both. So I can be the leader and kick off conversations or kickoff important. Um Professional development meetings or topics But I can also kind of take a step back when I see there's someone outs in my team that is willing or wants to take on that leadership role. So I really have a balance of both. Mm hmm. Something else that makes me a very effective leader. Is that I have the ability to, It is I'm very approachable. I have an open door policy. I never feel like I have to be alone and if someone's coming to me with an issue or a problem, I feel like I generally have ah the ability to listen to them while also the ability to give you know feedback when necessary. And I don't always jump to you know, cutting them off for um trying to fix their problems. I think I really have the ability to listen and think critically and then respond to them um in a variety of different ways. But I think being approachable and having people in my life who constantly come to me with their problems or their needs um shows that I am an effective leader and that I do have that ability to kind of, you know, be that step up for those who need it. Um In other ways I just feel like I'm a positive person to be around. I am not negative in the workforce. I feel like people gravitate towards me because I have that positivity um but I'm also very realistic, so my positivity doesn't away my realism and I feel like sometimes when people are positive they don't see the you know, important factors that sometimes aren't always positive. But for me I could be very positive, but I'm also a realist. So I understand that there are going to be negative, there are going to be you know, stressors in the job and that being positive doesn't mean being unrealistic. Yeah, I've taken on leadership roles before.

Firstly I would like to thank you greatly for this opportunity. I have been asked to discuss my leadership skills and abilities with you today. So I'd like to start with my current role. I've been in my current position for five years, it is forward facing and very client driven role and I believe that especially this aspect of the role has given me the opportunity to gain and develop a wide range of skills which would be easily transferrable to a manager's position in the same area of work in my current role. I work with a wide variety of the population in a very diverse and multicultural area. This has been extremely rewarding and eye opening um and I have also seen some challenges that come along with this. A lot of these challenges come down to miscommunication and errors in the communication process. I feel that I have learned to develop my communication skills in such a way that would enable me to be a fair manager, but also to appreciate that one of the things that people appreciate the most is to be listened to, therefore with good communication skills and good listening skills. I feel this is when you can create a solution for both parties which benefit both. I also work as part of a multidisciplinary team which can have its challenges, especially when people have their own ideas um and ways of moving forward. This has sometimes led to conflict within the team. I have been on several different training courses concerning conflict resolution and I'm currently the lead in my area for helping defuse tension within our working team. I have learned that it is important to listen to everyone's points of view and then come back as a group and discuss everyone's thoughts to come to an amicable solution. On several occasions I have been nominated as team leader in my area of work. I have gained good feedback from my colleagues who believed that I provided good leadership skills and support when and where was needed in terms of myself as an individual. I feel I am both dedicated and driven. I feel very strongly about my work and my team and want the best for both the team in which I am working and the clients that we are serving, therefore the manager's role I feel would suit me very well, as it would still enable me to be on the shop floor as it were dealing with people on a daily basis, but also enable me to enact change and hopefully benefit both my colleagues and those in my care.

And so again I use supportive development action plans and to help people identify their current strength and development areas and we work on those quite regularly usually once every fortnight or once every month depending on the level of capabilities that person has and the level of support that they need. Um I also do sickness management um in line with our policy and procedure and so I effectively I support my employees to return to work and I do this through effective conversations um may engage with occupational health um if I need to to help support and transition my blade back into the workplace, look at any Justin's that may need to be required for the person who turned into wear. So again, that could be in the form of phase, return to work if it's been a long term absence, equipment adjustment duties, um and roll adjustments. And in terms of kind of my leadership skills, I also, as I mentioned, look after a department, so I have operational skills um I manage a team within a large contact center, busy contact center for private insurance. And so I helped support ensuring that I have the right level of staff across the day. Um identified any um unforeseen absences on the day, such as sickness paid leave emergency leave and ensuring that have moved people around and to make sure we've got the right people to deal with our call, signing one time in our demand and I'll review any offline activity, take this out, add it in, move to somewhere that suits us better during the day. Um I'll strategize with those departments to utilize their resource and to help support during our busy demand periods as some were required our work in conjunction with our planning teams again, to maximize any opportunities and where we're seeing lower pockets of demand to support, showing any higher periods of manager in that particular day. And I'll review that cross the week as well and make sure that, you know, we've got any unforeseen circumstances mitigated as and where possible.

I think the most important skill for leaders to have his communication, communication skills such as active listening, empathy and respect. Leaders can help build strong connections and foster a positive team environment, thus limiting employee turnover in my last role as a team manager, I want to strengthen my communication skills to become a stronger leader. I attended a presentation on clear workplace communication, I used these skills to become a better speaker and a more efficient manager. I designated an open office hour where I invited my team members to visit and share their thoughts with me. This increased our workplace communication and help my team succeed. In the first month our team increased sales by 10%. I think approaching new new tasks is also very important. I create a plan first, so therefore you know you've got options in case one option fails. Um I asked my my team questions and I implement any feedback in my last role as a team lead. One of my team members had to leave suddenly in the middle of a project. We had a very strict and important deadline, so I stepped in to complete the additional tasks and assure we have completed the project on time. I had previous experience in graphic design but the team member who was left in charge of website layout, I had never worked with layouts before but I was confident I could learn quickly and adapt to these additional responsibilities. I conducted some additional research, learn about the best layout practices. I made my first draft and asked senior team member feedback. I used this feedback to create the rest of the layout by conducting research, asking questions and implementing feedback. I was able to produce a website layout that please the client. I think also you need to have some of your own personal experiences outside of the workplace to perhaps be the best leader you can as a variety of experiences. Um And for me I volunteered in a South African animal rescue facility which has helped me become a better leader in this role. I've strengthened my interpersonal skills with a variety of different people and animals. Um And at the animal rescue I greeted incoming customers, I showed them around the facility, asked some questions and matched them with a new pet. During this experience I gained empathy skills and the ability to connect with others inside and outside of the workplace. I believe this skill now helps me effectively connect with my team and communicate better. I think a very important point also being a manager is resolving conflicts um and you're always going to have conflicts no matter what position you are in. Um but it's your job as the manager to resolve them as quickly as possible without as little interference to the business. I resolve conflict by encouraging open communication and creating a positive environment. In my last role, I oversaw a team of healthcare professionals to team members, had different approach to patient care. I set a time where the three of us could meet to discuss the different approaches. I asked each individual to explain their reasoning and feelings towards why they believed that their idea was the best I mediated the conversation to keep actionable and positive. Towards the end of the conversation, we outlined a solution together, we created an alternative approach that combined techniques from both nurses involved. I think all of the above reasons would be why I'm a good candidate for the job and um hopefully you've learned a little bit more about my leadership skills and abilities as to why I would make a good manager at your company.",POSITIVE,0.6051,0.0008,0.3914,0.0027,651.0,LOW,6,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),12.26,1,0,0,"Bachelor's degree (e.g. BA, BS)",Female,8.56061,8.885517,8.571153

Some of those skills include someone who is approachable, good at listening, great communication skills, both with team members and with other departments, the ability to resolve conflict also between other departments as well as within your own um group of people that you manage as well as being able to work with many different people from many different backgrounds and also possible conflicting personalities and viewpoints. In the past, I have worked as an audiologist for 10 years during that time I have developed many different skills that would make me a good vantage. For example when working with patients you need to be able to listen to their problems and concerns and come up with solutions to resolve them. A lot of audiology is counseling and listening to the patient's speak about their day, their problems and any issues that they might have that come up also. You have to take those concerns and those problems that the patient is having and explain why and how that is happening to their friends and family as well. Yeah, it has also given me great communication skills. I have to speak to patients about hearing aids which can be a complex and abstract come concept and I have to make those concepts applicable to that person's lifestyle to that person's family, friends job and make it easy for them to understand. You also have to explain things like bands and channels and hearing aid features and explain to the patient why one hearing aid is significantly more expensive than another and this is the ability to do this is also to break down those abstract concepts and make them understandable to people. Also, since all my patients have hearing loss, I've had to learn to speak clearly and confidently so that they are able to understand me regardless of whether or not they are wearing hearing aids. Our clinic works with a diverse population of people of various ages and cultures, abilities and hearing loss levels. This has given me the skills to work with many different types of people and personalities also have to work with a diverse group of co workers, clinic staff positions on top of the variety of patients that we work with. So this has given me the ability to mitigate conflict and be able to propose new ways of approaching problems to mitigate that conflict in the future in terms of being a great managerial. Also think you have to have the right personality type. I have a great energy, I work hard, I learned quickly, I'm very friendly and also approachable, which I think as a manager um you don't have to be friends with everyone that you work with but you have to be approachable enough that they will come to you with your problems.

My first official leadership experience was in high school, my senior year when I was captain of the cheer team, I learned a lot about myself in this position and about being a leader at the beginning of the year, I thought that I could, if I said to do something they would follow, but I didn't realize that you have to first build trust in respect with the people you want to lead, it is not just about um Selling someone to do something and then following. So this year I managed a team of 20 girls, most who originally were not dedicated to the team. Um, and I had to learn how to build that dedication and the desire to be successful, which throughout the year I learned came from leading by example and getting them to become intrinsically motivated. Another experience, I had also, my senior year of high school, I was a senior on the competitive dance team outside of school and this, I wasn't a leader in the official sense of the word, I had no official position, but as the senior or as one of the seniors, I had to motivate the younger girls and people on the team and get them excited to compute my team previously had been very successful in previous years, so the younger ones assumed that this just came from the name of the team, but it was actually due to our relentless hard work. Um, so I had to teach them and try and demonstrate once again through um just through my actions, that hard work is what makes a team successful success doesn't just fall into your labs. So that was a second leadership position that her leadership experience that I had. Additionally, a little bit later in my life as a senior in college, I was a member of a sorority and this is another case where I had no official leadership role by lead by example, because during sorority recruitment, there are many, many long hours and in it, during it you have to be motivated to recruit the best potential members and I had to stay motivated. Once again looked my best, I demonstrated, I lead by example by making sure that I came prepared every day, looking my best and that I was motivated throughout the day even at the very end of the long days, um I was still excited and that I committed the importance of this event to the younger members who had not previously gone through it before. Finally, um I now am in a more official leadership role, I am a teacher, so I am the leader of the classroom. Um I'm still in my first few years, so I'm still trying to figure it out, but I've learned a lot in the past two years, especially that respect is earned and not given. So with each new class I teach, I know that I first need to rebuild respect with the students, I showing them respect if I want them to treat me with respect, I also have to treat them with respect regardless of age and regardless of how the child initially treats me. Um, so just once again, leading by example, is one of the main things I've learned. If you want people to act in a certain way, it's important that you acting that way as well. So in the classroom I show respect to every student and I encourage that they show respect among themselves and in turn that I've seen positive results and that they respect me as well.

Um I think you can see this from my work history as I worked as a waitress at work as a sales leader, Zara, I've worked at a I currently work at Boots and I worked in different roles throughout the company, whether that's sales, associating, covid testing, um kind of leadership roles and supervising. So I think because I worked in a range of different roles from literally the bottom and kind of the lowest skilled employees and I've worked my way into the higher skills and alongside that, doing my master's degree and working in like professional companies and interning in those, I think I have a good knowledge of the kind of broad needs of the team and I think from that I understand a range of different perspectives, so I know what the different roles require, but I also know what is required of them and I can kind of sympathize with the people who are working in those positions and I can kind of speak from experience when I'm speaking to them. I think within teams, leaders can often get kind of ignored and kind of disrespected because they don't empathize with the team and I think that that's a very key aspect of leadership because I think kind of communication motivation, creativity positivity and most importantly feedback are the key kind of pillars of leadership and I think I would be good at kind of bringing those aspects to the role from which I have experienced when I was president of my sixth form, I kind of really understood the importance of being a representative of my peers and kind of knowing the importance of listening to what they need and being able to feed that back, but at the same time being organized and being able to know what is expected of me and my team. So I think from that the importance of representing both your team and the company as you're working, it's kind of like the middleman in that, I think that's something that just understanding in the role is makes you a good leader because I think in my degree I've been very analytical and that's a skill that I've been kind of groomed to know, so from that I can read scenarios whether I'm in them or you know, watching them unfold and I can take away what went well and what can be done even better. So I think from that I will always drive for efficiency and maximizing the potential, so from that that makes me a good leader because obviously I know what can be done better and I obviously want to implement that and bring that, I just think I'm quite positive and quite an emotive person, so I think that I can relate well to each member of my team and I can kind of empathize what positions they're in because I can read kind of emotions, I can read what is needed for each person and what maybe if they're not in a great mood today, kind of playing into that and kind of tailoring there roll to what works for them because I think when you're in a job and you're kind of being expected to work at like the top all the time, although that is important, we're all humans. So I think being a leader that kind of empathizes and kind of understands the point of view of every employee that's that's really important and that's what makes you a good leader because you understand the needs of your team and everyone. And I also think knowing everyone's strength and weaknesses and being able to kind of create development plans with people that work for them, that's something that's going to drive maximum efficiency because you're working to what they deem is on their times and like putting in growth and development phases. So they don't seem like they're stuck in a role that they're going to get something out of it. And at the same time the company is as well because you're putting in development plans for that. So I think I'll be a good leader because I understand the key aspects of leadership and what is expected from me from my team and for the company.

It's a great question. Now let's get into it, why am I the best candidate for this managerial position? I am, I think that I'm the best candidate for this managerial position because I have the necessary leadership skills and qualifications. Now I did be a bachelor's degree in logistics and supply chain management and one of the other courses that I did was managing. So I think that I have learned enough as you can see that I passed that course of the distinction. I now do have the knowledge that is necessary for this particular post. And also when we talk about leadership skills, I have the perfect leadership skills, I have critical thinking skills, I am able to strategize, I am able to work under pressure, I'm able to work overtime if needs be, I have compassion and I am good at resolving conflict now, the last one that I mentioned which is conflict resolution is something that I think people tend to underestimate a lot. This is also a leadership skill that you need to have as a leader more, especially in a managerial managerial post, because a lot of conflicts tend to rise up in the working space. People have all kinds of stresses from home and what wherever and therefore because also we have different personalities then we tend to clash here and there. So as a manager, I need to have the proper um conflict resolution skills and make sure whenever I fix um whatever it's a problem that we might have at the moment, I fix it as fairly as possible and I am not biased at all Now, another leadership skill that I mentioned was critical thinking skills, That is also important because with critical thinking skills, that's where strategy, strategy ization comes into place, you cannot strategize if you don't have the necessary critical thinking skills, you need to be on top of your toes each and every moment of every day, every minute, every second because things are constantly changing in the business world and I as a manager needs to be on the lookout if I slack on my job, it means that the company is now slacking and we will not reach our targets, which is bad for companies, so I need to be on my toes, make sure that everyone is doing their tasks, everything is going according to plan and there are no problems and I also need to think about the future, any problems that might occur and how do I plan on stopping them if they do occur and um even if they do occur, what will I do? I do, I have plan A B and C or am I just sleeping on the job, which is something I will never do. We always planned for unforeseen circumstances. Now, another thing that I also wanted to highlight was strategizing, it's important for us to strategize because that's how we will redefine the company Now when I am in this position, I plan to redefine what this company means to people by redefine. I mean that we will take it to a higher and better level than it is right now, which is my job as a manager as a manager, sorry. And another thing when I, another skill that I need to have um as a manager is that I need to have leadership skills. Now, when I talk about leadership skills, people tend to think that leader being a leader means I get to my job in the morning and I just hand out all these tasks to my colleagues or whoever is working with me. Um and I don't think that's being a true leader, being a true leader means that yes, I do hand out these tasks, but then I do follow ups, regular follow ups and I do do the dirty work with my colleagues with my stuff if it needs be because some days, yes, there will be a need for me to do the day to work with them and show them how it needs to be done. That's how we work together. That's great leadership skills. Because also another thing of great leadership skills is uplifting others. I will be working down there with them, uplifting them, showing them that um you need to pull the ropes this way and that way we need to work together because someday I would like to also see them in my position. So that's also one of the qualities that I need to have that I do have actually as, um, a person, a candidate that's applying for this role, I hope that this was enough and sufficient for you.

I was first and then talk about what I believe manager and my role developed clean that you have and so first of all I believe that in order to be a good manager you need to have exceptional listening skills. I think that's the first time an excellent communicator and I have those skills. I listened definitely and I take notes when I'm meeting was first of all clearly want my gender is that meeting, but also I'm listening actively to my team. Um I didn't believe the communication skills is really important, so it's all very well to listen, but we have to communicate firstly the overall arching theme of what you want to tell them, um how they're going to deliver it, what it's going to look like when I see it happening and how they can implement it and take on board their ideas as well. So I don't believe in top down As 90 100% of a managerial role. I believe you have to take on ideas for more staff from your team, but it your ability as a manager to be able to we knees out, go with the stronger ones and also go with your vision and hold your vision. Um First of all, in terms of managerial skills, I would start finding out what personalities all my employees have within my office. So how do they communicate, what are their personality types in terms of how is the best form of delivery of instruction for them, what kind of feedback do they need and then make sure my team all understand how to communicate with each other because if you haven't got that as a basis, you're off to a disaster. The other strand of my managerial is exceptionally organized. I know exactly what my team are doing and I know exactly what my timelines are. My dad looked so strategically, I think that's one of the most things a manager can do. You have to be able to put something in place, oversee the timeline, understand the logistics of how to get there, but also keep on task and make sure that while they're independently doing it, you're encouraging motivating, giving the skills to do it and making sure they have those resources to do it the same time, you're making sure we are moving forward where we need to be. Um I would say my skills are the ability to lift and the ability to communicate strategically logistically. I'm excellent at providing an overview for myself, for my managers, but also for the people that I work with. The other thing I think is also really important to problem solving with whatever team you have, you're going to have maybe issues from a daily structure point of view in terms of the physical physicality of running the office, running um the daily jobs but have to take place in order for the big picture to happen at the end of the week. Um So I'm very good at making sure that that will happen. I'm very good at making sure I've delegated those jobs of organizations, so we're well stocked and well resourced. Each person clearly knows what they are doing. There have been many reports back to me not to undermine their authority to make sure we're all on board. So there aren't any tiny little mistake that will actually make the whole process for that. The other strength I have as a manager is I constantly look at my um processes of how I'm doing it and I evaluate what I'm doing and I know that there are always ways to them. So in terms of that way ground is that you set the structures in place, you look at how effective they are and at the end of um turntable of um the project, you then look at it and think okay, how could this the best improved, did this work also feeding back from the staff but also feeding back from their customers. So you've got that triage of people that are involved. It actually, I think it's just a tiny small step saved thousands of um So I think that's really important. I also think another really good strand I have is that I'm a very good people person and life happens and you need staff that are working at the top level and it's being able to motivate them, give them those motivations with the key goals and rewards that you can give them. And I actually believe in making sure that you're not minimizing those, you know, you're making sure they do have time with their family, that the workload is being managed, There's ways that we can reduce it so the management skills or the ability to listen, the ability, traceability to prop himself.",POSITIVE,0.8974,0.0014,0.1003,0.001,832.0,LOW,5,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),16.01,1,0,0,"Bachelor's degree (e.g. BA, BS)",Female,8.672646,8.99873,8.68405

I think that's a great trait for being a manager because the your manager, the manager only works as good as everybody that is under them. It's a whole group effort, it's not just like the manager is the bread winner of the past. Also I was told that I handle things better, so there is a not so great situation happening, then I am that one person to be like you know it's okay we can get through this. So I have a very positive outlook on situations outside of that. I feel like I can also bring to the table that I I would like to sit down with my team and hear their opinions because it's always a great idea to have a kind of 2nd pair of eyes on the situation. I feel like it you get more insight because only one person you see one thing, but if you have three other people with you then you're kind of serving more than you would if was just you. I also think that um it's really good as a manager to be able to compliment achievements, whether they be small achievements or big achievements.

I also think that if I was the manager that I wouldn't just be looking at the team that I'm over, I think listening in and hearing and seeing other teens and how they work can also help me make sure that my team is running smoothly because what you think is good might not be good for other people. Also, I think that treating everyone equally would be a great element to being a manager. I know that it's really easy to kind of start to form friends in the workspace, but for the employees to feel like I will listen to them, I feel like making sure everyone's equal and not showing favoritism will help our group in general. And if that happens, I feel like maybe the employees will feel comfortable enough to not only talk to me but talk to the rest of the people in their team because at the end of the day, it really matters what the team is doing and the manager's kind of head over that, but it's a it's a like all purpose things",POSITIVE,0.8147,0.015,0.123,0.0473,505.0,LOW,1,97.0,1.0,Using only (2),9.990001,1,0,0,"Bachelor's degree (e.g. BA, BS)",Female,8.095754,8.428799,8.3533

First of all I would like to say I have experience as being a manager. I have worked in all different settings, um I have worked in a restaurant setting, I have worked in a child care setting as well as others, so I'm pretty well versed in managerial duties and expectations. I would also like to say that I am an extremely organized and put together person. I'm good at meeting goals and making sure that everyone on my team is able to meet their not just their team goals but also their personal individual goals as well. Also to kind of build on that I am an extremely respectful and kind person and I try to make sure everyone's voice is heard and that I am sensitive to everyone's needs. I feel like that is extremely important when in a workplace it's often something that isn't given as much consideration, but it is such a crucial thing in making sure a workplace um is run well and making sure um and building on morale. So if you don't have a good balance of that, it really um can inhibit a company and even can hinder progress as well. So yeah, that's really important for me and I always try to exhibit respect toward all my employees and to all my coworkers. Another reason I would be an excellent manager is that I'm a very creative person, i in situations where there needs to be a solution and if there's nothing already written out, I'm really good at finding creative solutions and solving problems in um unconventional ways so that we're still able to meet our goals in a timely manner. Um and also I am an extremely, um I'm really good under pressure. I've definitely been in situations where um high stress situations and that certainly is a challenge at points, but I've learned really good ways of dealing with that and making sure that overall workplace performance is still running as well as possible despite any um changes of plan or whatever reason for an up and up taken stress and also under in these situations, I am really good at remaining level headed. I never lash out at people and I'm still able to hear um people's needs and um what needs to be done and get it done. Yeah, so um yeah, I'm also really good at delegating, so if a job needs to be done and it's not already written out somewhere, I am good at finding the best person and um finding and making the best use of their time and finding a good fit for them to get a job done. So yeah, I'm able to tell someone and even like a whole group of people the what their specific jobs should be and how they are able to work together in order to meet our to meet our goals.

I do think that verbal spoken communication is the best way to do that because I think things can be misconstrued over text or email and you can keep it nice and succinct while getting to the point. Um I would also say that I have very good problem solving skills, I am adapt to using my initiative to think up with new ways of solving problems, reaching different solutions and I do think that every problem does have a solution and it can just sometimes take a little bit longer to find the solution, implement the solution and see what works best, I think that necessity is the mother of invention, so um you know, coming across problems and minor hurdles can be good for a company and good for business and I believe that you know mistakes and things like that are the best way to learn, so I don't think it would be a setback at all and I think that's a really positive kind of mentality too and promote and apply within business role and particularly that of like a managerial position um and also I would say that I'm disciplined, my time management skills are excellent, I have really good organizational skills, so that means that by extension, I am you know adapt at organizing other people teams, seeing what works best for different members of a group and this harks back to my communication skills because I do think that different people work in different ways and that's really important to acknowledge um so I would say that my discipline within myself kind of reflects on those that I work around, um it motivates other people, I think that offering initiatives and having goals for a team or for a person to reach, you know, with incentives, be that a bonus or be that drinks um on the company at the weekend and I think that's really important not only to sustain kind of good trajectory, keep on time with targets um and get results, but also to sustain morale within a team, within a company and you know and that that means that employees have this like respect of you because you do achieve professional results but also you're aware that people's lives don't always revolve around their their their job um and they have other interests and other needs outside of you know receiving their pay at the end of the month. So I do think that that's important. Um Yeah overall I would say that those three things, my communication skills, my problem solving ability um and my discipline and self motivation are the most important things um within a managerial role and are three things that make me stand out as kind of an ideal candidate. I think there are other aspects um that can be brought to a position like this um You know I've touched on organizational skills but also I think that there's like a personable quality about me which means that um you know I am respected within the workplace but I am also human, you know, I'm not a robot and people are able to approach me both in terms of a personal nature um and also with ideas or kind of fresh takes on approaches that we're doing in terms of the clients and everything and transcribing can be quite a lonely, a lonely, solitary role and so I think it's really important that in a in a managerial position you have someone that you can turn to, that you can talk to and that is going to offer you kind of personal support, particularly obviously with Covid at the moment. Quite a lot of transcribing roles that I've worked out recently are very much work from home remote working. You know, you're kind of isolated from an office from other people and you don't have that same work with culture. So I think that's important to cultivate within a team as well.

My name is sally and I believe that I would be a wonderful candidate for this management position. I have lots of experience in the subject matter, which I believe is important. If you're going to manage other people, you have to know the tasks that you're managing, you have to understand from the bottom up what's involved so that you know what the stressors are on the employees whom you're managing. I have 40 years of experience in this field. I have performed every conceivable job in this field because I started at the bottom and I worked my way up. So there isn't any position in this office that I haven't already performed myself. I know exactly what the challenges are. I know exactly what the stresses are that the employees are going through and I understand how best to ameliorate those challenges I have been. I have taken over the years numerous management courses I have in fact won awards in four separate years for manager of the year. I believe that my employees really appreciate the type, my management style. I'm more of a servant manager. I'm less authoritarian and more of the type to just make sure that all of my employees have everything that they need in order to succeed because in my experience before I came into a management position, that's the most important thing. It's really frustrating for an employee to have a manager who doesn't understand uh the job and just demands that it be done without understanding what could possibly be preventing the work from getting done. Are the tools that the employee needs training that they need is something going on in their personal life that they need help with. Do they need assistance with childcare, with transportation, There are all kinds of things that outside the workplace that can affect an employee's performance inside the workplace. And I believe that with my management skills, I can bring more of a team mentality to the group so that everyone works as a team so that everyone works together and all of the employees feel invested in the success of the group versus competing against one another. I've worked for managers who have treated their employees like Children and in response, the employees behaved like Children trying to leave work early every day, even though their work wasn't done. I on the other hand, as long as an employee's work is done, I don't mind if they want to leave early, I don't mind if they want to come in a little late, as long as their work is getting done. Because the bottom line is, that's what we're here to accomplish is the job. And and um if you only care about dotting the I's and crossing the teeth, the employees aren't going to care whether big picture the entire job gets done and overall it's getting them, getting the work done is like pulling teeth, you have to drag it out of the employees versus encouraging them and uh giving them something to work work toward uh so that they can have the so that they're internally motivated.

Um and our job was basically to engage with the kids and make sure that they had a good time, Bostonians sexually and they went out on the streets, we had activities like football and ball games, one off activities every once in a while, And then it was crucial to engage his eight year olds, 8-12 year olds and make them make sure that they felt safe and that they could come to us if they had any problems. And then moving on, I became a teacher. Um I think it was very similar that I needed to engage with these Children, I needed them to feel safe and I needed them to respect me. And so through that I learned to set boundaries and learned to motivate people. Um more importantly, I'm not that not everybody is motivated in the same way, you might have one child that's motivated by getting points in the class. Um I have a competition with others, that's how they respond by feeling like at the top of the class or wanting to be the top of the class and you have others that just want to be told excellent work, this is how we improve here. And and so it was really important to learn how to motivate and more importantly, to avoid the motivating people I am and to help them feel safe and that it would come to me because I think one of the most of motivating things is being stuck and not knowing how to proceed and not wanting to ask, I'm sorry and one of my biggest things as a leader is making sure people feel comfortable letting me know that they're stuck or confused, they don't know what they're doing next. I want them to be able to put their hand up and let me die and then we can proceed together and then going forward. I was a manager of a team in an investment fund and so I manage accountant, um office managers, business analysts. Mhm And so with that comes a lot of different personality types again, and not december to a classroom, it's important to realize that these people have different ways of being motivated, working and being demotivated ways things that stress one person doing, stressed the other personnel and vice versa. I am. And so yeah, with a team of adults, I've learned a lot of skills essentially boundaries. Very important. Still, I need my team to feel like they have to respect me and there are rules that they need to follow, but I also need them to feel safe and comfortable coming to me with any problems or even suggestions, I want them to feel like I'm human, but I don't think I'm perfect because that's never going to make them feel safe and comfortable coming to me. I am and ultimately the teams are only going to benefit from open communication between everyone. Um I don't want them to blindly follow me, I want them to point out flaws in my plans, but at the same time I'm aware of their personalities as well. For example, two very gifted people I manage, I have one who I'd like to leave everything to the last minute because that's how he gets his work done. It's the stress of last minute that he gets his best work done. Um and so I give him tight deadlines I had and it was a child and everything. I gave him tight deadlines and sometimes those deadlines change. If I've been something in, in two weeks time, I might let him know, I think it's due in a week before it actually is so that he gets it done on time and is ready to be checked. So why not last minute totally. It's just him being asked in it or he thinks he's being of it because I have something else that um it's stressed by tight deadlines. So when I know that our project he's doing, I let them know as soon as possible so I can slowly chip away at it and that way I get the best out of both of them from different measures",NEUTRAL,0.4094,0.0948,0.4939,0.002,765.0,MED,10,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),15.42,1,0,0,"Bachelor's degree (e.g. BA, BS)",Female,8.900331,9.220266,9.195738

So in academia, leadership is one of the best possible skills to have as a teacher, as an educator and and as someone who works in higher education, I should be chosen specifically for a management position because when it comes to both work environments and personal environments, I often and the one and the one to be chosen to be the leader of the group or I am the one that my supervisor's approach most frequently to lead groups of students for teaching um experience classes and other leadership roles that may come into play in my current position. So when I view myself as a leader, I view my view the idea of leadership and being a leader has um something that should be completed and approach as succinctly as possible when there's a task that needs to be completed, all instructions should be followed as closely to how they're written out as well as in a personal um at a personal level and in friendship groups when there's a problem to be solved, I'm the first person to hit the nail on the head, see the problem for what it is and hit the ground running to solve it. And I'm the one who usually is asked to be the leader of the group and help my friends or piers solve the issue at hand. So being a leader and being a leader in a management position allows me to complete any tasks that need to be completed as I can, as as succinct as succinctly as I said before as I can. So I find leadership itself to mean that not necessarily leading others, but leading myself to view the tasks and assignments and things that need to be completed in our specific order, how what are the, what is my job, how do I complete it and how do I complete it in the most fast and um I think a harmonious way to ensure that the job is done and ensure that I'm leading others to make the correct decisions to make sure that things flow smoothly. So while I never have worked in a management position, I am a teacher, I am an educator and educating people is a form of leadership in itself. Um as educators, we have to lead students in the correct directions to make sure that they're getting the information that they need and can complete their assignments and in my case and higher education their degrees with the information that they need in order to succeed and excel in their careers going forward and managing students is a way of leadership in itself. Oftentimes whether high school or college students have no idea of what they're supposed to be doing and they look to educators to be leaders to enable them to fulfill their needs in school as well as complete their courses as well as they possibly can. So for me as a leader, I when I'm teaching or when I'm in a job, I like to be at the forefront of the problems that should be solved and I like to help people understand how things should be completed by looking at how things can be completed as quickly as possible. But in a way that can be um understood as being the most uh effective way of leading themselves through the problem, the assignment, whatever there else needs to be done. And that's why I think I'm a good candidate for a management position because I have these skills through higher higher education, as well as my own personality, that allows me to be the person who hits things head on, who wants to make sure that I complete everything as well as I possibly can, and to make sure that others are able to follow me and do the same things themselves. Even if there's any confusion, I should be the one that they approach to understand and feel that they are well aware of how life needs to be approached itself.

So first of all I'm a teacher and um in part of my job as a teacher, I'm ahead of a year group. And um what I have to do within that year group is to organize a group of staff who each have a four meat. Um So I'm good at organizing the meetings that we have together. I need to produce um an agenda and sometimes there will be a logistical things that I need to talk through. And I think I have good leadership skills to be able to isolate the things that need to be said in these meetings, but also sometimes there are decisions to be made. For example, if the their Children are behaving well as a year group and they need to um yeah go ahead and do something there. So quite often there are behavioral cause to be made. Um And then the next thing is I'm actually a mountain leader and what my skills as a mountain need to enable me um to do is to encourage a group of people to move safely through the mountains. Um And to be a leader out on the hill, you need to assert confidence. People need to believe in you as a leader because essentially some of the terrain we might be going on might be risky. Um They may not feel safe and it's your job as a leader to instill confidence in your group, to enable your group to work together as a team. Um and you need to be trusted as a leader. So for example, if you as a, as a leader, I feel confident in my subject knowledge in what I'm teaching. Um and that confidence passes on to the people that I am leading over. So for example, if bad weather were to set in or somebody was injured, I'd like to think that they had the confidence in me as a leader to get them through. Um But also my role as a mountain leader. I lied, Duke of Edinburgh expeditions And in Duke of Edinburgh expeditions are commonly have 10, 11 groups of young adults out on the hill at a time. And as a leader and I'm good at the logistics of um overseeing the whole operation and who will, who will, who goes where. And so part of being a leader sometimes is being able to organize and cope with the logistics. Um so for example, I need to organize how those groups are going to get there and where they're going to stay, where my staff will stay, what, why staff will eat, what campsites have, what facilities and so all of those things. And as a leader each minute morning, I would brief the participants on the day. But also I briefed the staff and the staff and need to be highly motivated as a leader, I need to make sure that the expedition is a pleasurable experience for them. A lot of them are volunteers And motivation is a huge thing because you want them to come back and also as a staff, I need to figure out who I want to somewhere. I need to do the safety calls. So I've got 13 groups out on a hill. If um, for example, one year we had snow coming in March and they were novice groups, they were bronze groups and I had to make that safety call of whether it was safe for them to carry on. I have had to pull them off. The decision was to pull them off the hill. So then I needed as a leader to be able to organize my staff to make sure all the groups would be reached, um, to be able to pull them off safely. So I am, I think being able to relate to those staff to trust that staff will do what I want them to do because I've led them sufficiently and manage them sufficiently and that I have a personality where they can trust me whether the authoritative enough for them to do what I do want them to do, but at the same time, not so overall narrative that they become resentful or by making bad calls. Um, they, they're not following it. Um, and then the last thing to do with leadership and management, I'm also a netball coach and the team that I coach as a leader, um I need to be able to identify within the team the needs, or any weaknesses in the team, and then I need to be able to follow through with that, and you could take that into any workplace um to be able to identify a problem, how will we correct it? Let's work together to correct it. And what is the outcome, um and also as a team um to be able to motivate as leader if they've had a loss of their halfway through a game and they're down.

I believe that my professional experience thus far has helped to cultivate my leadership skills. I regularly take on new tasks outside of my typical work responsibilities, which I believe is something that a leader should often do when we were in the process of developing a new workflow for the company, one of the team members had to suddenly drop out and I stepped in at the last minute. So I was unfamiliar with some of the tools and software that was used. I was confident in my ability to adapt and learn quickly so the project could be finished on time by working to a deadline and organizing my time efficiently. The project was completed without too much of a problem and has now been regularly implemented to streamline our processes as a leader. It's also important to be able to resolve conflicts on the team and working within a customer service role has given me invaluable experience relevant to this. Occasionally we've had one or two difficult customers um who have had disagreements with my coworkers regarding their service or their potential purchases and I generally am quite good at handling these situations in a calm manner and I'm often successful in reconciling both sides in some cases, ending these disagreements on a positive interaction has brought us back some now regular customers who continue to support our business. I'm also a regular volunteer as a science ambassador and they give regular talks to students ranging from primary school to secondary school. Um I talk about my education and my career journey and offer advice for how to approach university applications or answer interview questions much like this one. Um It's important for me to act as a role model for these kids, so I can be an example of someone they look up to and aspire to be and I do my best to conduct myself appropriately as such. I also find that as a recent graduate it's easier for me to empathize with the worries and concerns of old students about to embark on the next chapter in their educational career journey, since it hasn't been that long since I left school myself and I believe my ability to empathize with other people and connect with them will be integral to my success in a managerial position related to my previous point. It's important to be trusted by employees and be able to motivate them within my team. I take on the role of a natural leader, since we're quite junior in the company hierarchy and it can be intimidating sometimes when we need to speak to other people, we're all a bit shy, but I have encouraged myself to step up and act as a voice for all the junior employees. It's important to treat managers with respect. But over my time here I've developed a friendly and perhaps even close relationship with most of my senior employees. It's the same ability. I have to develop deeper interpersonal connections with employees both above and on the same level as me, that I hope to apply in a managerial position to gain the trust and respect of my team. To summarize. I believe that my skills and experience thus far have shaped me into the ideal candidate for this role. Although I was initially shy and not necessarily the most outspoken person, I have overcome this personal challenge and encourage myself to speak up and speak to everyone. Communication is highly valued in a managerial position such as this, and I have extensive experience in that regard, whether it's presenting my project results to senior employees or imparting career advice to younger students to help them more, to help them be more confident in themselves by treating others with respect and integrity. I received the respect of others in return, I'm not afraid to challenge myself and take on responsibility.

I believe one of the most important skills within a management and leadership role is communication. You can't be an effective leader or manager without effective communication. So that involves being an active listener when someone's talking to you and gaining an understanding of their perspective, having a degree of empathy to people that need that and are justified to have it and also respect your other co workers. If you can build a strong connection between your team and promote a positive environment it will increase productivity. So effective communication is vital. Okay if you know what's going on on the ground around you then you can manage it before it becomes an issue. I've done lots of C. P. D. In relation to communication. So clear workspace, clear mind that was about having an open environment so everyone could take the floor and had the opportunity to discuss any issues. So you could be proactive with those before they escalate. Um I'm methodical. I like to plan and ask questions whenever we're presented with a project or a new proposal that we need to put forward. I gained feedback from my team on their ideas. So there is a joint approach rather than just my perspective on things. I understand the importance of deadlines. If you set a deadline you must meet it. Otherwise you failed within a team. I've had a variety of different experience within management as a result of Covid. So as well as managing my own department due to absence is a result of covid I've had to manage, manage other departments that are outside my remit and perhaps something I have no expertise or background in. So I've had to be quite proactive and research. Those departments rely on the staff to give me input because obviously I've been checked in at the deep end and I've coped with that really well. Okay. I've also had to cover classes on, you know, I do math classes, but I've had to go into an engineering class or a motor vehicle class, pick up a scheme of work and run with it in a fairly pressurized environment. Um This has strengthened my interpersonal skills and it's helped me deal with different dynamics within different teams. So I haven't just gave my experience in my own team, but in a variety of different teams outside of my remit, I've done a variety of CPD on conflict resolution. You need to be on top of any type kind of conflict and resolve it as soon as possible so that it doesn't impact on the team. I have to make difficult decisions within my management role and I'm comfortable doing that. It's not about being popular, it's about making the decisions that's going to be productive and may make a counter productive environment. Okay, have a huge amount of experience in terms of payroll, human resources, all those kinds of areas and I'm used to networking with different departments. Um I work in a college environment. so I'm relying on other departments because we all share students that we're managing and we need to rely information so we're able to do that effectively. So multi agency network is also something I have a huge amount of experience in. I do feel I have a lot to bring to the job um a lot of different ideas. I've worked in lots of different environments and I feel that I could bring a lot forward to the job. In terms of management, I've managed lots of different styles of people. So people there confident people that require training and I find that I'm quite effective at pinpointing what kind of training each person needs, and then looking at the relative CPD routes to help them gain that experience and knowledge and make them overall more confident.",POSITIVE,0.6572,0.0019,0.3394,0.0015,663.0,LOW,6,99.0,2.0,Using only (2),13.7,1,0,0,"Bachelor's degree (e.g. BA, BS)",Female,8.750687,9.071879,8.912644

So thanks very much for inviting me to interview today for this manageable position. Um There are a few reasons why I feel like I'd be the best candidate for this position. This is based on my current skills and my experience and what I believe I can bring to your company. Um So I have already been in management roles in the area of data analytics for the past seven years now. This has been across both academia and also in several different departments and companies. Um So as part of this I've managed a very wide range of people. So this has been from students and university leavers through people entering career changes and also very experienced members of staff and contractors. So throughout all this I have managed these people to an incredibly high standard um and have produced very good results. I attribute this to my management style which is a very mentoring manager style. So I aim to give my staff a lot of autonomy. I really pushed them to achieve the best they possibly can in their role and I support extensive learning and development and everything they do. This has given both me and my staff a lot of success and I often find that they move on to far more senior roles very quickly as a result of both my work and their work really. Um So on top of that I've also done a lot of work in managing change in the companies that I've worked in. Um So I'm sure you can appreciate that data analytics, data science very forward looking, very fast paced role. I've successfully managed several aspects of change in departments. So this has been a rollout of version control technology using get and get hub. Um So I managed this from initial project design through leading the project in collaboration with digital partners, arranging licenses were appropriate and then rolling this out to the rest of the department with a combination of best practice guidance and also designing and leading spoke training for various colleagues around the department. And I've also been similar uh to this for a cloud transformation project. So moving outdated sequel and um in house based our studio onto a google based system using big query to replace sequel. Um and also using cloud based are So this serverless system has saved significant amounts of money for my department and has also less lead to less down time, more efficient usage and significant savings into terms of data warehousing. Um I also lead in several aspects of changing and improving staff in the department. So this has included managing an extensive training budget, so sourcing external training when that's appropriate, but also using my own staff and colleagues in the department to develop spoke training programs when this is more appropriate and has covered a wide range of coding tools and technology. Um So this included python R and big query but also more importantly and quite innovatively. I've done a lot of managing upwards with regards to this training, so engaging with very senior stakeholders, senior leaders in my department and engaging with them and analytical manager training. So this is for them to understand and make informed decisions about coding technologies that they can adopt. This has been extremely successful and has led to significant up skilling across the whole department as managers get on board with this. So um in conclusion I would say I'm very ready to take on another challenge and I feel that I would be the ideal candidate to lead transformation, lead change and obviously build data science and data analytics capability within your company.",POSITIVE,0.8098,0.0021,0.1875,0.0006,622.0,HIGH,14,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),10.87,1,0,0,"Doctorate or professional degree (e.g. MD, DDS, PhD)",Female,9.35299,9.667007,9.503742

I just need this short video to describe why I would be a great fit for the advertising managerial position. So I want to start off by saying that I don't actually have any managerial experience, but I think if you have a look at my resume um and my work experience, work history, you'll see that there are a lot of skills that I've gained throughout my time in the workforce that definitely translate to a managerial position. Um So beginning with my experience in hospitality, I think there are definitely a lot of skills in that field, particularly after having worked there for around four years that you pick up and develop that are really beneficial for any future jobs, but particularly a managerial position. Um So I was in or around a like a senior all rounder at a restaurant which did functions upstairs and dining downstairs including outdoor dining um and being one of the most senior staff members, my job sort of involved having my own section of the restaurant to look after, but then sort of knowing what was going on in the entire restaurant even while I was focusing on a specific area. So um that's where I think delegating was one of the really key skills as I sort of knowing that my section was ok, everyone is taken care of, need to know what's also going on in this section and this section in this section, even though they weren't necessarily mine and then if I did happen to notice something that maybe wasn't being done or something that could be done or something has been missed, having the presence of mind to know, okay, I have things to do in my section, so I can't necessarily go and do all these things myself um but this is the kind of task that can be delegated, you know, differentiating between things that okay, I should do this myself, this is a priority for me and something that no, you know what, I have things I need to be focusing on, this is there is someone whose job this is so I need to delegate that someone else rather than you know, trying to do everything yourself. I think it's a really key part of managing the teams, balancing all the responsibility, People have their own roles. Um additionally to this, I think people skills, communication, working in a team, all of those things are really important in a managerial position and this was definitely something you have to take into account um working with other servers, as you know, not everyone is necessarily going to get along with each other and hopefully you would think that most people have the ability to sort of work with anyone and you know, it's a job, just get down to it even if you don't personally enjoy spending time with other people sort of deal with that, but I do think as a manager regardless, really imperative to know your team and no, the relationships and how they work well with and who they don't um even if it is, I hoped they would not be able to work together. I still think as a manager it's good to know, you know, if I put these two people together, they're probably not going to work as well as if I put this person here and this person in this section, like you can't just as a manager not have a connection with your team at all and expect them to be able to work to the best of their ability, like it's part of your role to sort of have that relationship with them and know them so you can get the most out of your team. Um In addition to hospitality, I'm also studying teaching um which obviously is the teacher, you're the manager of the classroom, the leader of the classrooms and it's definitely a and overlap between those two roles. Um While I'm studying primary teaching, it's you know, not adults, but I definitely think behavior management, classroom management strategies translate to any other managerial position. As you know, they say, teachers have eyes in the back of the head, you definitely do. Um because even when you're focusing on something in front of you, you need to know what, you know, what is this person doing over here, Someone over here is struggling, this person is not working to the best of their ability. You really need to what multitasking while focusing on what you need to do, also have a sense of what's going on in the classroom or you know, the workspace the team around you. Um So I definitely think that's an invaluable asset that I've gained from studying teaching. Mm hmm. Yeah. And I think as well, just both in hospitality and in teaching, dealing with the parents or customers, it's just another skill dealing with people being able to solve problems in a way where both parties are happy with the outcome. No one's getting upset. You know, staying respectful. Even if you personally feel like you're not in the wrong that happens and you have to be able to deal with it. And I think, yeah, that conflict resolution skills also very important.

Um So first I have several years of experience um overseeing a team of employees in my current company. Um And so I have been successful in meeting all of my goals, time deadlines um in staying on target for, you know, the goals that I have been set for my current position. Um And so I think that although this management position would not be exactly the same responsibilities as my current job description um that these skills would be able to transfer over to this position very well. Um I think something that makes me a very good competitive candidate among these skills are that I'm very organized. Um So I I am very conscientious about meeting deadlines and about making sure that we're on a regular track to be keeping up with those deadlines. Um And so it's not just sort of the day before I'm checking in with my team and realize we're not really where we need to be. I am definitely doing regular check ins with everybody and setting timelines for each and every one of my team to make sure we all have a very good understanding of what's expected of us um and how your work quality is supposed to be. Um And so in addition to that, I think I'm also a pretty good communicator with my team. um you know, I definitely value that my employees or the word that my team has other things in their life going on. And so um if there is something that they have going on that might be keeping them from being able to meet those timelines and, and goals that I've set for them, I'm good at communicating that with them, keeping an open environment where they feel comfortable to come and talk to me so that we can bold resolve a mutually good understanding of how we can get that work done even if they have something else going on in their life. And so I think in that way they feel my team feels um respected by me, and so they feel the motivation to want to meet some of the more lofty goals that I might set for them because they know if there's truly struggling or if down the road something else comes up, that they are not able to be keeping up with everything as they were before, that I will be able to work with them and respect their needs as well. And so in that way, I think that I'm a good leader because um we do have that mutual respect and with my current team and that's definitely a quality that I would intend to bring into this current management position if I um am hired. Um and so those are some of the qualities that I think makes me a really competitive applicant for this position. Um I'm definitely very motivated to learn, so I know that there's some skills that I will have to grow into within this management position. Um But I am very committed um to expanding my skill set and growing and applying myself and challenging myself. And so um I definitely think that it will not be an issue for me to try and catch up with some of these um you know responsibilities and expectations that you'll hold for me with this position. Um And again, yeah I I do very much value communication with my team as I mentioned and that applies to my supervisors as well, so if I am really struggling with something to understand something or if I'm not quite sure if I have the expectations completely correct. I do think, you know, I will check in with with my supervisors just to confirm that I'm on the right tracks that I make sure that my quality of work is exactly what you are expecting from me. Um And so those are some of the ways that I think it would be a really great manager for this position um And I would love to have the opportunity to demonstrate that to you um If you give me a chance with this job.

Alongside that, I have excellent relationships with all of my coworkers, including members of staff currently in the managerial sector, supervisory roles, front desk, the cleaning staff, everyone here, you know, I have a good relationship and I'm friendly with, which I think is so, so vital to this role.

Well I think I have several leadership skills and qualities. Um One of them is that I like to set a good example. I've noticed that when I set a good example others will follow subconsciously. Um at my job we had some issues with people always being late and in particular one coworker which her name is Layla, she was always late to work and I felt like she was proud of being late. So there was one instance where she came to work early and it was a miracle because she was never early and she was, she saw me there. So she kind of realized that I get to work on time every day and that was the last time she ever came late to work. It's either, I mean she just imitated imitated my punctuality because she was just as early as I was for the rest of the year. I don't recall another time when she has been late and even better my whole team started coming into work early and they have really good attendance and it's all because I was there all the time and they noticed that it's good to be punctual and they followed in my example so I know that I can set a strong example to follow and people will follow it especially if it's something good. Um Also if for any reason somebody is absent or or there's no one to take care of a certain task or project, I can always jump in and and delegate tasks to people figure out what's going on.

I'm very good with computers, I can learn new programs easily, any program, it could be from any website, um, very good at navigating these programs and very tech savvy. I can really just figure it out. Of course I can print from any printer, I can figure it out, change the ink, connect to the internet, I can figure all of that mostly on my own.

I'm bilingual and I am not as fluent in a third language but I can understand some words but that is also very important, especially in my area of work because I speak spanish a lot and I have to do it, I have to do it and our spanish speaking community is a big part of our business and I have to be able to talk spanish and we have a couple of members on the team that don't speak spanish and I really wish that they did. Um because sometimes when they don't speak spanish they have others do the work for them. I mean, I'm not saying, well that is what's happening, but it's very important to be bilingual and I'm very happy that I'm bilingual. So that is also another leadership skill of mine. I'm able to help more people and it be nice to know more languages and also I can solve problems quickly. Um I don't really feel confused, I feel comfortable and strong knowing that I will find a solution to my problem even if it's not an immediate solution, but I will find one. I'm a strong person who can persevere for a long time. I don't give up. I'm I'm only I only stop until I'm done and that's what I have to bring to the table.

And I have held quite a few different roles in my In my work experience so far started working when I was 15 and as a as a waitress And that was when I was 15 and now 33. And I do believe that each of the jobs I've held have showing me different management styles and I've taken to find that come to find my management style that I now have. I've been working as an accountant for the last eight years and I've had good managers. I've had bad manages. Um I've been lucky enough in Honeypot as a senior to have a really good client manager. And now that she's moving on, I would like to take that role on. I see that we victoria and I have very similar management styles. We're very personable, very empathetic. Two um staff. And I'd really like to carry on that momentum with the workforce. So I believe that I hold you know I believe that I do hold very personable persona. But I am a I know what it's like to be managed and I know what it's like to to have started from the bottom and I know what works and what doesn't work for me. I know that I and like to have kind of a feedback, two way feedback where A two way feedback. Where no, I'm being assessed as much as the other person being assessed on how they're doing their job. Mm hmm. Do you believe what you would call healthy tension. So, you know, I can't, I can't be a friend to everybody. I think well thought of within the firm already, I've tried to make my mark. But do you feel that bit of healthy tension, you know, setting the boundaries with staff. So with the new trainees coming in, I believe that um I'm someone that can approach knowledgeable. Eight years. Yeah. This 3rd firm of workforce I've built myself up. So being a bit more confident in the job roll now and my knowledge of the council attacks is really um, they're quite fast, especially what we deal with in the firm now. But I do feel like the trainees need to know that I am someone who has the experience and can impart that experience. But I want them to kind of I want them to make mistakes to learn from the mistakes. So I don't want to, at the end of the day, they can't come to me. But I want them to try and make those mistakes before they come to me. But also I want them to know that I'm there for a coffee if they want to have kind of an informal chat.

I also pride myself on being a good communicator with staff and colleagues at all levels across an organization. So over the last 20 years my management style has definitely developed into a style of management that does not involve micromanaging people. I'm happy to keep an eye on a junior member of staff and help them develop. But I believe in empowering my junior colleagues, enabling them to figure out for themselves how to learn, but also support them in their learning. So where I am working with the junior colleague, I have all the time in the world for answering their questions, showing them how to do a job, but I also believe in giving my people the chance to learn on the job for themselves to take ownership of a project or a task and try to deliver it. I also believe in giving people the space to fail and fail safely and know that they would be supported in their failure and shown how to turn something around to build on that level of having tried something and not having it work um but as a manager, I believe in supporting my team, I believe in empowering them to do their role and empowering them to take risks and try different things. As a manager myself, one of the things I think I excel at is both problem solving and bringing creativity to solve difficult problems, but also working alone but working with colleagues too, figure out how to tackle thorny issues and bring creativity to develop resolutions to problems where we might have hit a wall in terms of trying to do something. I'm very collaborative as a manager, I don't think you get anywhere very fast by dictating to people how to do things. I think you need to work collaboratively with both your own team and and in matrix teams across organizations to develop solutions that will effectively solve problems. Um I think one of the things I bring to the role is that I'm not afraid to delegate. I believe in delegating to staff so that they can take responsibility for for actions the same way I expect senior managers or directors to delegate to me and then leave me alone to find a solution or to go back to them and talk through what problems I might be having in meeting their expectations and together we can figure out a way forward. Um I think I'm very good at risk management and identifying where risks occur and what procedures and policies need to be in place to address those risks. I also think something I bring to a role is a focus on identifying where policies and procedures are not sufficiently documented because I've been in situations before where I've worked for an organization and people who have had the knowledge about how to do things have moved on, but documentation hasn't been left behind, which makes it really difficult for people knew coming into the roll to hit the ground running and develop their skills and their roles. So I believe in thoroughly documenting processes and procedures as well as being quite agile about problem solving. I think there's a fine balance between recognizing procedures and processes to follow, but also in terms of knowing how to be agile around those processes so that you're not too hidebound in delivering solutions. Um and I think I'm a very good planner and project manager in terms of motivating people to achieve success and understanding that it's not always money that motivates problem people, that people are often motivated by, praised by recognition from colleagues, whether that's from peers or managers. Um but a word of recognition goes a long way, particularly if you don't have the resources to be able to increase people's salaries",POSITIVE,0.7371,0.0048,0.2519,0.0062,712.0,HIGH,11,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),15.11,1,0,0,"Master's degree (e.g. MA, MS, MEd)",Female,9.2444,9.565682,9.484365

Um So a little bit about my background, I have first class honors in psychology degree and a master's in coaching and mentoring. Um I think both of those things are really important because a good leader needs to know how to deal with people and how to act with people and importantly how to communicate. Um So I've demonstrated how I can communicate to people on all levels. I've been a full time mediator for 13, 14 years now and that's mediating everything from forces to neighbors too, workplace disputes to complaints and to get a good resolution in those kind of situations. You have to be a people, person, you have to have empathy and you have to be able to listen. Um So leadership isn't about dictating, it's about listening to what other people say and then being able to make really decisive choices, so decision making is critical. Um So I've managed services through every aspect through to today where I'm running my own business and I'm self employed as a director of a company and I work for myself, also employee of the people. Um So I manage those people and that's well it's going really well. Um I like to think I deal with people with fairness and consistency. Um and honesty as well. I think people really respect honesty even if it's not what they want to hear. So for instance if we're having a quiet month or two in terms of case work, we know it's going to pick up, but I'm not going to pretend that everything's busy when it isn't when people aren't getting the amount of work that ideally they want, but they'll know they'll know it's coming in that respect me for, for that honesty. I also listen to them and how they feel the service that they work for could be improved and the things they want to see and changing the things that they want. Um for instance, seems to introduction of more flexible working through the pandemic where we're all working independently at home um and just having that ability to have a better work life balance, particularly with the nature of the work we do. I understand how difficult it is, I do it myself. So I work at every level obviously as well as being the head of the company. Um So I think it's not, it's about not seeing, it's about having that leadership but rob, but not necessarily seeing myself as the top of the tree. So my business and the way I see my business, it's all about the people who work for me. So my business is going to be amazing if the people that are working for me are happy they feel heard um and they feel like they have ownership, so which is something that I really promote. So a good team is also motivated, so I do what I can to encourage them. Um obviously recognition is a big thing, so I recognize when they do things really well and they obviously get praised for that and then motivated to do a good job. So selection of my team is really important to you. So I'm only looking for people to work for me who are doing the job for the right reasons. So the, the nature of the work that we do is helping of us. And I think in some helping professions, people prioritize helping the customers and they don't, and often that's at the expense of our own mental health and our own well being. So burnout is quite common thing to happen in helping professions and particularly in my field of work because it's basically listening to conflict on a daily basis. And so we have to support one another two and a good leadership makes the space to support the people that work for the company and also provide a space for everybody to to support one another and have supervision. Um, and to have feedback. Um, so that's a little bit about me. The only final thing to say is that planning is really important in leadership as well. So we I think it's always good to have something we need to know that we're working towards something to have an idea about where we're heading what's coming next and to really have that push to develop as a, as a team, you know, we all need to be on the same page. It doesn't mean we have to agree about everything, but we all we all need to have a drive towards the overall goals of the organization, and those goals need to be clear and fair and well communicated.",POSITIVE,0.6122,0.0021,0.3848,0.0009,823.0,HIGH,15,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),19.94,1,0,0,"Master's degree (e.g. MA, MS, MEd)",Female,9.06076,9.377232,9.205159

I'm Sarah I am 22 years old and I reside in London. So I know that I am, I think the best fit for this managerial role. Um for a multitude of reasons. So for a start and a little bit about my previous work, history. I've done years of tutoring that's both private tutoring and group tuition and I've got a bit of ta work behind me. So teaching assistant work at a school. Um so as a two time dealing with Groups of up to 10 Children at once. Now these kids are teenagers so that obviously the trickiest group of people to deal with. I'd argue that sometimes they want to be the class clown. Sometimes they're unbothered sometimes that over worked and super stressed, especially towards the end of the year and then you've got to work on, you know, calming them down and reassuring them. And then there's just lots and lots of mm different issues you face as a tour now. I I mean it's I think of it as it's like working in hospitality. You meet people from all walks of life, all different personalities hypes. It is like you work. I mean you are working with the general public and this is particularly useful for a manager real role because you learn how to manage different types of personalities and how to adapt your approach, depending on the personality type. Now there are three pointers which I think are key to succeeding in a managerial role. The first being. It is important to know how to command respect as opposed to incite fear. I don't think inciting fear is effective because people go back to doing things the way they want to do them the minute your head is turned commanding respect means people do things because they want to do them and not because they have to do them and that automatically increases the quality of work. The second point is strong interpersonal skills, so you've got to know how to build could relationships with people and sort of make them trust you and this achieves a couple of things. First it creates harmony within the group and then it also and which ultimately also increases the quality of work being produced, it's sort of synthesizes the group and then also it allows people to trust you too. It builds trust where people feel they are able to come up to when they have any issues or concerns, which is key to succeeding. Now, the final point, which I think is vital is to be a good problem solver. Um having said this as good, however good a person is and however suitable they are for a managerial role, there are going to be situations where they just don't know what to do or they might need a minute to think now in those situations, I think it is important to maintain the illusion um of control, it is always important to seem like you have everything under control, even when you don't because this is ultimately, I mean this ties in with the first point, really, if people have got to know that they can trust you in order for them to listen to you. So Those are my three points.

If I look down during these videos because I'm checking my notes. Shall we begin. Um I believe that effective leadership begins with great oral and written communication. And that's one tool I have. Um These are tools garnered over several years from a combination of education and work experience. I find that um Effective communication is a two way street. So to be able to communicate well I have to be an active and attentive listener focusing on everything from the words the person is saying to body language even so um in the past rule I served as a liaison between the outside clients and the company and I used power automate to streamline communications in such a way that We were able to optimize customer satisfaction by 25%. The second um leadership ability I have this problem solving. I'm able to look at the problem, look at the situation immediately identify the problem and then innovate to come up with interesting solutions. Like even if on the surface it doesn't look like it's a good it's it's possible to resolve. I'm able to figure things out and make things work. So in this way um we released an app and users were having issues with functionality so I coordinated the I. T. Department too these order processing and were able to increase company revenue by 10%. I believe that highlights creativity, flexibility. Um critical thinking, analysis, research and evaluating evaluation. Another skill a good leader has his delegation. So as a leader here you might find yourself inundated. Like as I have I have found myself inundated sometimes with the variety of texts which all had hard deadlines. So what I did was to and properly delegate workloads to keep my team productive and it's not just giving out assignments. I handed out the rules on the basis of everything's weakness and strength. So I do my best to not micromanage. So in this year's able to successfully manage a team of eight people and if you should call one of them today they don't have good things to say about me. I believe that shows organization, strategic thinking, forecasting, scheduling, attention to detail, excellent oral everything, communication and then I'm also good at giving and receiving feedback from the people I work with. I mean it's not just being able to give it to be able to receive it. So I am maintain an open communication policy my my colleagues so that you know we get constructive criticism delivered both ways to ensure that customer experience is happy actually go out of my way to regularly seek feedback about what I'm doing right and what they think I could do different. So I I do this by ensuring we have the sharing sessions twice a month and then the I mean one thing that came up was um office work hours, some people thought they could they should be able to I have some flex time, you know work longer days sometimes and then shorter days sometimes. So something that's easily resolved. So we're able to sit down and putting things together. And I believe that highlights conflict resolution, interpersonal skills, active listening, empathy and then excellent written and oral communication. So all I know, I believe that these skills have listed essential tools for any leader to have an essential for a money manager to have and would assist the growth of any company.

I feel that there is a lot of experience that I have in my background. I graduated back in 2018 um with a double major in marketing and finance. The company I was working for at the time I was doing an internship that last semester which then led to me being hired full time. Um In this position I learned a lot about social media marketing. Um The manager actually that hired us on hired me and another coworker on, she actually quit two weeks in. So not only did I have to learn to adapt, I had to learn new processes, I had to learn to basically function with someone else in a position that wasn't really established yet, it was just a growing department and then to have the manager leave, it kind of put a lot of strain on us to figure out you know what was going to work what kind of job, but that job entailed, we didn't have much guidance, so I worked there for almost three years and I just, was a lot of me learning about different aspects in marketing. I didn't just wear one hat, I wore multiple hats, which I think is very important because you want to, as a manager have knowledge in many different aspects of the marketing and understand the difficulties that come with each position. Um And not only that it's very people centric as far as the team that you have to build a team that you have to work with with. Covid 19, I ended up having to not only work from in office, I had to learn to now work remotely. So that transition also allowed me to figure out how to work with contractors online. You know, my teammates, I had them all on zoom, so we have to learn how to coordinate and work together. We had time management processes, like a sauna and um monday dot com that helped us come up with different tasks, timelines, you know, everything. So we were able to track everything. I had a lot of contractors that worked with us so I had to give them tasks. I had to manage them, had to make sure that the projects got done. Um and that was that job and then my second job did email marketing. Really, really amazing job. I had a great manager. I was able to learn with her. We had touch bases every single week. Um, you know what, she was able to shed light to how she would talk, how she would approach different situations. I'd come up with a problem and she had different ways for me to fix it, different ways for me to think about things. I've done a lot of research as well on my own as far as Youtube, just learning different management styles, different ways to communicate with people. You know, you have to have that experience of course and that strategy, but not one person is going to know everything. So for you to be just that people person and understand that everyone has different emotions in different ways that they react to certain things, you know, some people might be motivated by money, some people might be motivated by time off, they might be motivated by great skills, you know, words of affirmation. So just learning what every person, you know really excels in in figuring out what their passion is and helping them grow because when you help them grow, it not only helps you feel like you're doing a good job, but they're also being the best that they can be in that position which is I think very important, important in a leadership position is to understand who your employees are and what they need in order for them to succeed in the job that they're in. So for me having such a great manager, I was able to watch her, you know react and you know kind of talk with other departments, other other coworkers that I had to just figure out, okay what is it that makes sense for her? What is it that um people, you know respond with her if there's a conflict that comes up how she kind of handles that, which you know every situation so different, but she's very calm, she's patient, she doesn't blame, you know, she kind of tries to see the positives of every situation which is something I really valued from learning from her and I feel that, you know, you want to be the leader, that when someone sees you, it's like what you want to leave them at the best point that they can be. So my my take would be from all the experience that I've learned professionally, as well as just dealing with other people and what would work for their situation.",NEUTRAL,0.3928,0.0472,0.5266,0.0334,833.0,MED,7,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),18.96,1,0,0,"Bachelor's degree (e.g. BA, BS)",Female,8.922918,9.242665,10.0738

I am very excited to be applying for your role. Uh There are a number of reasons why I am a suitable candidate for the managerial role. Um I have about eight years of experience in leadership and managerial positions. Um I've worked over the last eight years in three different companies um in a leadership capacity. And so my experience is predominantly retail but very different kinds of retail. So I did um the pet industry for a little while, I did um luxury goods for a little while, I did entertainment um but all within a retail setting and then all leadership positions within those. Um There are a number of skills that I was able to develop um and demonstrate over the last eight years. And so one of the first skills that comes to mind that landed me my first leadership position was simply being able to model behavior. Um So as a candidate for this position, I can assure you that were I to get the job. Um There's nothing that I would not ask one of my associates to do that, I wouldn't do myself. Um So I make it my personal mission to be proficient in every area of the business. Um And then that makes me a very good resource um and a good model of behavior for my staff. Um In addition to that I've been brought into several stores with my last company um to deal with growth plans um and to really help boost our teams. And so some of that is basic growth plans, so where we at, where can we get you to the next level. Um My company is very passionate about growing people, I'm very passionate about growing people. Um So that's a role I've had the pleasure of killing. Um And then for some of the tougher conversations I've dealt a lot with conflict resolution. Um So I've been brought into stores to work um with some of our teammates who maybe need a little bit of one on one. Um and some development plans um predominantly this tends to happen when we're not when a store is not reaching their objectives, so for instance if we're working or we see the operations team is not meeting their quota for products getting to the floor um then I've been brought in to help mediate that. Um In addition to that, I have worked with developing teams overall, so a little bit of that um unison of people development to ensure that we're really meeting the targets and and also really helping people grow within the company, giving people opportunities to um develop some of those leadership qualities themselves. Um So from that standpoint I think it'd be an amazing candidate because I've worked a lot with helping people grow, helping people reach their potential um and really expanding the business in that way. Um from a product side I have a lot of knowledge as well, so in my positions I have done a lot of work with are receiving, so operations, I've done a lot of merchandizing, I've done a lot of loss prevention work. Um So really I've had the chance to see a lot of different sides of a business that helped keep it run um which is valuable. There's a lot of transferable skills there, so if you need something to look pretty um if you need to make sure that your product is safe and and your standards are being adhered to, I am certainly a suitable candidate in that regard. Um And then lastly I've had a lot of chance um to be a leader in customer engagement. So I have run a lot of events mostly for Children. So the start to finish the what is it going to be, what do we need, who do we need and how do we implement it and then actually implementing it. Um And then as well as a lot of your promotions up selling that sort of thing. So I hope that you'll find from this interview that I do have a lot of leadership skills and abilities that I am looking forward to helping you grow your business with.

You've asked me to do an exercise for between four and 5 minutes on the reasons why I should be appointed as a manager and you've asked me to run through in that time, the sort of things that I think I should talk about to be a manager, so I'm going to concentrate in three areas of skill. The areas would be my experience, my man management and my project management, obviously there's an awful lot more to it, but for the purposes of this exercise, those are the three that I thought might be of interest. So starting with experience, um the area of work I chose to talk about, chosen to talk about is housing development with the local authority, housing development is basically the bringing forward of housing built within a local authority area and that involves things like dealing with developers who come to the council for planning permission very often they don't know the rules and you need to run through the rules with them. You're also trying to meet the needs of the area. Most areas have a waiting list for people that want houses, So that's the sort of area that I've been working in for about 15 years. Local authority basically means council, so all areas of the country have councils, I work with projects or they could be very small, up to five houses being developed or very large, 30 plus houses or extremely large, 200 houses. It depends where they are being built, whether it's in villages or towns I work in conjunction with my housing development colleagues, people like myself who have an experience of working in this sort of barrier. I work externally with developers, I work with counselors, I work with local councilors, parish councilors, I work with the planning team, There are targets to be met very often. So that has to be borne in mind when we're looking at all developments, the main areas or the areas that take up the main bulk of time, apart from the advice giving center around local needs and housing development needs, surveys, both of which I've been in charge of doing, undertaking, writing and reviewing. Um basically it means getting the information from the local parish and looking what the need is in a parish or town and finding the developers that could bring those houses to see those needs. Man management isn't my forte. And I think a good manager should be very forthright in saying what they're good and bad at. As a young person at 25, I ran home With a 15 staff and five residents. Nothing to do with housing. It was all to do with special needs By 30, I was running a day service for 150 people with 30 staff I think because I was young, I just wanted to be friends with all the other members of staff and actually that backfired. It didn't work at all and I learned very quickly that you need to be very professional and have a professional line firm unfair listen and give time, but let everybody know what sort of policies you're following. Um I had to deal with all sorts of things. Mental staff, mental health staff is physical health bullying between staff relationships between staff stealing from staff, staff stealing, um under under performance. Um so it's an awful lot to learn and like I said, it's not my forte, but it is something I can do. Um and I learned the hard way how to do it. Finally, I wanted to talk briefly. I've only got 44 seconds left about project management. My current project that I'm dealing with is the heating installation of a ground source heat pump into an old folks home. I was involved with tenders and quotes, appointing the contractors. I've also had to get staff involved. I've had to look at skill sets, I've had to up skill staff or send them off to be up skilled. Um and we've had to do an awful lot of work with liaison with the residents because I'm sure you appreciate its elderly people. It's a lot of changes, a lot of upheaval, The heating systems failing and we basically want to find a way to put a nice new system in for them.

Well, I would say one of the first uh skills that come to mind is tim building and the ability to build trust in a team. Um That is important because in the past, in my first two positions before applying for this job, I have found that this has been key to be able to achieve um goals, companies, set goals or to be able to finish projects. Um So For example, I lead two different teams, one was larger group of 10 people, one was smaller, a group of five people. And I found that in both cases I had people that were different in terms of their skills, in terms of their motivations, in terms of their abilities because some people are more senior, I have worked longer in the company and some people our juniors and have less capabilities, but this has to be amalgamated into one uniform team that works towards one goal that has that is rallied so that we can achieve the objectives because higher management um needs objectives to be met. Um and we always have changes in teams and changes in um personnel and that cannot affect how a project is led or achieved. So um my skills were put to the test because I had to understand everybody's needs, I had to be empathetic. Um A lot of active listening was used um to be able to, I understand everybody's needs motivations and to be able to motivate them to be able to inspire the different members of my team so that we could achieve our projects. Um we could complete the projects on time and achieved good results and in both cases we did get bonuses because we were able to surpass the goals that we had to meet. So for me, um this sums up tin building leadership, motivational skills and inspiring a group of people that are very different also, I would say um the the ability to communicate clear messages is very important as a manager because we always get um announcements um from higher management that we need to communicate to our team members and ensure that they understand and sometimes um the information is complex and so in my case I had to break things down so that everybody could understand and that we could be on the same um at the same pace, especially for the new members of the team that don't have, they didn't have the jargon down, um they didn't really understand what was going on, but needed to be brought up to speed quickly, so they could be at the same level as um people that have been there for a while and I would say also organizational skills are very important because I had to be um I had to, you know, be on time even earlier and show that everybody, you know, was on task, everybody understood what they had to do, especially for the projects when we have projects to complete. Um I had to ensure that I knew that everybody was on a specific project and a specific task, sorry, and that we will hitting all our goals. So basically, you know, for me, I believe I am the person that you need for this job because I have the experience, I know how to lead a team, I know how to um you know, lead projects and show that we get, we said we meet our goals, so thank you very much for having me.",NEUTRAL,0.3325,0.0056,0.6589,0.003,616.0,MED,10,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),9.970001,1,0,0,"Bachelor's degree (e.g. BA, BS)",Female,9.007623,9.326658,9.389759

Okay, so you we're going to ask why I should be a leader or why I want to be a leader first. I have a list over here. So I just go over here, please excuse me. I don't, I made some notes. We get to build up the self worth of others. Like that's something I really enjoy doing. Like it's good to see somebody come in, they might not have a lot of confidence, but you can see the talent and potential in them and you just need to help bring that out of them. That can be from offering mentorship or giving them projects that allow them to stretch themselves and learn different things. And of course no one is going to get it all right the first time, but that's why management and leaders are here to remind them that if there's something they don't know and they make a good effort in trying to solve the problem, then there's no reason why we can't help them or we can't give them a little bit of a boost to the next level because in the end, if someone could do it all, then there wouldn't be a business, you would hire everybody and you could just do everything and that's not how it works. Next point, oh, we get to create, we get to bring people together going off that last point. The idea of bringing people together is actually a super important one to meet as well because we can't do it alone. It's like the old saying goes, if you want to go far, go alone or if you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together together, being with the team, everybody can bring something to the table. And I would like to be a leader that encourages people to bring their differences to the table. Like it's not just, it's not just straight people, it's not just men, it's not just women, it's not just people of a certain demographic or mindset or neurological makeup, it's people from all of these aspects. There are definitely we all have spots that we're not missing. I don't want to say blind spots because blind, it's not anything negative. It's something different. We all have spots that we're not aware of and bringing in a diverse group of people and learning how to manage those people because everybody has a different management style. And I think if your moods go from, if your moods ebb and flow, you might be better at managing one person one day or one person the next. It's always going to be a challenge. And I'm excited for challenges like that. And I think very important part is how leaders, you get more responsibility as a leader, you get to serve others, your company, your staff members beneath you and your community and by listening to all these people, you can become a more rounded, you can become a more well rounded person yourself. Yes, leadership is not just bossing people around, It's helping people get to where they want to be, so that they can be the leaders of the future is serving other people in your community so that you get a better understanding of where you live and how to contribute and how to reach out to people across various socio economic standards and viewpoints, basically becoming a leader is saying, I like other people, I like where I live, I like what I do and I want to do that on a grander scale to help more people out on a wider level. And the most important thing is about leadership is you don't stop like when you become a leader, everything is still working, like you're still learning, you're still learning how to manage people, you're still learning about new projects, you're still learning about new technology. Nothing stops just because you have more responsibilities, a white collar job in office with a door and a paycheck, you have to put in the work, you have to be worthy of that because not everybody is worthy to be a leader, but I am because at the forefront, I like to put others before myself most of the time, sometimes it can be to a detriment, but most of the time I know my limits, I am, I am happy to share the load with other people or to give them that boost up over myself because I'm already Mhm I'm already in a leadership position in my community.

Um In the previous work that I used to do, I used to work for the civil service um benefits agency. Um This incorporated working in a large department, I took on many roles in this department. Um such as finance officer, adjudication officer. I ended up working as a supervisor supervising 10 staff myself. And this required lots of skills for me to perform this job effectively and there's different stratas within the civil service. Um The stuff that I had under me has quite a pressurized job in dealing with difficult clients. So I felt that it was very important to be supportive. So they didn't feel that they have a pressure beneath them and also a pressure above them. I wanted them to have a support supportive manager there so they didn't feel pressured from above. But at the same time I needed to be assertive and have good assertive skills in dealing with unexplained absences or poor performance. I needed to be completely fair with them. Um As due to my staff reporting um that would lead to um that would lead to promotions. So I felt it needed to be completely fair. So I took time away from the job to ensure that I was dealing with the more fairly. Um I work for music school at the moment and I don't have any position of management within it. Um But I feel that I will be very suited to, to managing a music school um particularly as I've been a manager before, I'm very experienced within the job that I do, so for me to manage people who are doing the job that I do now, I feel that I have a good insight into what they would be required to do. Um I hopefully would be give a balanced approach to the job as I know the job very well myself um and I think that I'm, my skills are, I'm very, very committed, I'm very punctual if I say I will be somewhere or at a meeting, I will make sure that I am at the meeting a couple of minutes before um I'm very, very reliable. If I'm asked to do something, I will do it and I would expect people under me too be reliable as well. Um I lead by example, I like to show that I can do the job hands on. I would give examples of me doing the job hands on and I would also like to get involved with them in what they are doing. So I would spend an element of doing the job that they are doing as well as managing them as well, so they know that I'm on their level and I know exactly what they're doing and I think that's important that I'm not just put on a strata above them and they are down here that we are here working together and so they have respect for the fact that I know their job. Um I'm, as I say, I worked very, very hard. I will give 100% to whatever I do and I'm very, very committed to whatever I take on. Um I'm accurate. I take time away from the job too, monitor how I'm doing to reflect. Um I would obviously do this with with staff that I had underneath me. I would take them to one side, give them special time, make them feel valued, important. And most of all ensure that they feel a valued member of staff because if they feel happy they're happy with me, then I think that they would work well. So really, that's, that's my, yeah, a little bit about me and I would be very grateful if you would give me the opportunity of applying for this management position, please do come back to me if you have any queries or questions that you know of um and I look forward to talking with you very, very soon.

My floor is communication and interpersonal skills are precisely what your company needs to achieve its marketing advantages. And I will not only bring my skills and experience but also the clientele are built over the years. And so my background experience as a sales and marketing of representative equipped me with the relevant skills for this role, very ambitious and determined to achieve my goals and my enthusiasm to get work done, motivates my team members and obviously it's important, I understand your team and so as a leader obviously we'll work together in a team, we want to know what the team wants from us and we want the team to know what we want from them and so they know what's expected to them and how to find help if they needed. And obviously we used the communication skills to lead by ensuring that everyone working on the project understands what they're doing and when they're doing it. And so there's obviously if I have to use different teams and departments will know who to contact where to go, all of that. Obviously Effective communication is a two way street. So if one of like my clients are like agents want to tell me something, I am there to listen to them. So obviously effective communication is a standard In the past six months, my team and I were ranked among the top 10 sales and marketing teams in the industry, so it's not just my background that brings like that makes me the ideal candidate, but also make excellent management and leadership skills as well as my communication skills and some able obviously delegate what what team needs to do. So whether it's organizing like a party and events or if we're scheduling too put everything together and what we need to do by when and attention to detail obviously will want every little bit covered. So we're no, we can go forward in it and obviously if there's a conflict would rather be able to manage that. So, but obviously talk to everyone, have a team meeting, listen to what where colleagues and tell them where and be able to give those advice and how they would move forward with it. Um teamwork obviously is important and see if someone's struggling, we can delegate another person and maybe help them for a little bit and talk about what the need, what they want from us so we can help them moving forward. So it's not all one sided and obviously we need the motivation for the team because obviously if your team is not motivated to do their job, nothing's gonna get done really to the best ability that they can. So maybe have like coffee breaks, um get donuts and everything in, have a little get together after work, just make it not all about work, have a little time where you're doing stuff outside of work together and then obviously you build up that team work in the working together, it just goes well in hand.",POSITIVE,0.969,0.0003,0.0304,0.0003,586.0,LOW,6,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),12.88,1,0,0,"Master's degree (e.g. MA, MS, MEd)",Female,8.865545,9.187892,9.451935

Um I think that I am cut out to be the manager because I have a lot of quality. So you would look for in a leader um From a young age I always felt like I was a leader. Um I participated in sports my entire life and I was the captain of my team and that requires you to really have the ability to bring people together. Um Also to encourage your teammates whenever you're losing the game, things aren't going well never giving up. And so I think starting from whenever I was in high school, I I always liked to do that and then whenever I was in college I ran track and I was a full time student athlete and I think that that taught me a lot of time management grit, perseverance because it's not easy to um I have a three or four hour practice and then go home and do all of your homework and um still maintain a good G. P. A. I had a 3.9 G. P. A. Throughout college and so um that taught me a lot about just never giving up and I think that translates to being a good leader. Um So then whenever I graduated I went on to get my masters degree and I got my masters in education while I was getting my teaching certification And I was 1/5 grade teacher for three years and that's kind of an entirely different level of leadership because not only are you you know in charge of a group of Children, you're in charge of educating them and teaching them how to be responsible members of society. So I I feel like throughout my teaching I learned a lot about patients and every single day whenever you're teaching, it's like you have to be putting your best foot forward because you're wanting to keep students engaged, you obviously have to practice time management, you have to keep the students motivated and what they are learning. Um so that was like being a leader and being a role model um whenever I was teaching and then I got pregnant with my daughter and so I decided to stay home and so now currently um I'm a leader in a different aspect I and taking care of her all day um and I'm trying to be the best leader and role model that I can be for her and I use a lot of the skills that I learned whenever I was teaching too, um try to make fun and engaging activities for her and also I just want to be setting an example for my daughter and I want to teach her how to be a leader in her everyday life um with her friends and at school and doing the right thing, so that's kind of, I feel like how things have evolved for me as far as me being able to lead in all aspects of my life",POSITIVE,0.5828,0.008,0.4073,0.0019,516.0,LOW,3,97.0,1.0,Using only (2),6.73,1,0,0,"Master's degree (e.g. MA, MS, MEd)",Female,7.548113,7.89211,7.503082

I am Eliza. And I am going to talk about why I think I would be a good candidate for a managing position in a forest school setting. So I have experience working as a manager and the various in various jobs that I've done. So I have worked with in a social media team as a manager where I have had people working with me and I've had to pay attention to the work that they're doing to give them instructions to check the work that they're doing to provide feedback and to support them. And I remember working in that team, I had really good feedback from the people that I managed. That they liked being managed by me and they felt supported and that they liked me. So that was a good first experience of managing people. And after that I had more experience working as a manager within some kitchen of volunteers where I managed a group of volunteers to create Food for 250 people. And these were a group of people who may never have worked in a kitchen before or done any cooking before. We had some instructions and recipes to follow. But I had the role of making sure that everybody knew what they were doing. Everybody had a job and that everyone was doing their job okay. And they felt okay with what they were doing. So there were a lot of different people to oversee and I did it really well. I believe I felt like I was doing it while I felt confident doing it. And again, the feedback that I had from people was that they felt supported and that they felt like they knew what they were doing and that I remember people saying that I helped the team to feel connected, that everybody had a role to play within the team. So we had a good cohesive team and I remember people also saying that I helped the atmosphere b com even when we were working under pressure because I managed to stay calm myself working under pressure. So in addition to having experience, I also believe that I have a really good personality for being a manager because I like to be friendly and approachable um which means that people can come to me if they have questions or if they need something and I also like to be considerate of others um and to to make sure that people feel ok to know what they know what they're doing, they're enjoying what they're doing or if not then how can we support them two, enjoy what they're doing and thrive in what they're doing. Um So I really like to listen to people and to give them the opportunity to express themselves, really, really enjoyed being a careful listener and making sure that everyone feels okay and knows what they're doing. I think those are really important qualities for a manager to have and I also really like to support people's development. So if I had a team of people then I would like to um make sure that each person felt like they had progression in their roles. Um And I think again that's another quality that is really good quality for a manager to have. So yes, I do believe that I have good experience and personality and qualities that would make me a good candidate for being a manager within a forest school setting. Um And I think I will do a really good job at it. So I would very much like to be possessed considered and I believe that I could be a great leader.

I think that I would be suitable to the management role in preschool education because I have many years experience in this area. I have been a primary teacher for 20 years and for 18 of those years I have managed preschool or as we say in Scotland a nursery class and to do this job you need a variety of different skills. Firstly I have a lot of knowledge and understanding of the Scottish curriculum and how it operates and how to implement the curriculum to help Children in Scotland. I have lots of different skills that I can bring to the job. For example I'm an extremely calm person and I think that's important. Schools are busy places, they're full of Children. Different members of staff and parents come in to. So each person has perhaps a different problem, different needs and you have to be able to keep calm and juggle them and respond to them differently. I have found that in my current post as a nursery teacher that staff often approached me with their problems and I think that indicates that they trust me, that they feel that I listened to them and also that they feel um that I give good advice and that I have knowledge of what I'm talking about. Um I have in my current position in nursery, I have several members of staff that I manage. They all have a different job to do in nursery and each person plays a different part in supporting the team, so they all have different needs, um different skills and different ideas and opinions and it is my job to lead meetings because we plan together as a team. Um and it is my job to lead meetings and decide what activities we're going to do for the Children and how we're going to improve our service. And I also meet with parents to collect and collect their reviews on this service and how we can improve in the future. So I'm able to communicate with different sets of people from different backgrounds, with a different understanding of the curriculum and different ideas and sometimes these people disagree and it's my job to help them perhaps compromise and meet in the middle um so that we can find a way forward that is best for all the Children in the preschool. I am up to date with current practice regarding Scottish education is something that I feel very passionate about delivering a good service for our Children. And I think if we have a happy staff where everyone feels valued and supported, then that creates a wonderful learning atmosphere for the Children and they will pick up on this atmosphere in the nursery and I think I have a central role to play in that. Um and I think there is not a problem that can't be solved. We can all work together as a team. I think that I'm good at including people and quite introverted person, but I'm really happy to listen to other people and take their ideas on board and I think that helps them feel valued as a team member. I think as a manager it is really important to listen to people. You don't always have to take on board their ideas, but you do have to listen to them and let them know that they are valued.

You are there to push them to the best of their ability to make your group um and your team be stronger than they can be. I think a leader is not someone that is taking the forefront and making the attention all on them, but making sure that everyone is shining, everyone is able to push themselves and get something out of every function, every task and feel like they're developing um within the company or within the department that you're working in. Um over the years, I have had experience working with council members, delivering leadership awards and events that are catered towards different groups and communities and ensuring that they feel confident with the work that I deliver and they have the ability in me to um know that I can deliver what they're thinking, if not above what they're thinking and develop, develop a common view across the board. Um I think when it comes to, you know, I believe that when it comes to being a manager, you need to be able to have a reasonable sort of um manner where you can help and assist people by pushing themselves as well as pushing yourself and coming outside of your comfort zone, but being able to um lead people in a way that they don't feel like they're being demeaned or condescend to, feel like they you're being condescending. I think it's a way of having a sense of radical candor of um positive, negative, positive, that everyone kind of walks away, feeling um encouraged, feeling enlightened, feeling convinced that you believe in them and that you need them just as much as they need you. Um I think the leader and a manager should be willing to um lend their ear towards projects to be able to have a personal, somewhat personal relationship with their staff members as well as being in a position that they can talk with everyone across the board from the person that cleans the rubbish to be able to deliver the same sort of caring consideration to people in higher positions. I don't just I don't just think that leaders are always at the forefront, sometimes they need to be able to take a step back and the other people shine, that makes your team's ability to progress, makes your department's ability um to shaped in different sorts of dynamics.

I also have learned that it is very important to listen to those who may be under me because they have very valuable input, especially if I'm coming into a new environment where I am the leader and there have been others there who are under me, but who have been there longer than me, they have so much um wisdom about the job that they could help me out as a leader, so it's very important to listen to those people under you. And also I was being a good leader is being able to delegate tasks and not try to micromanage and try to do everything yourself, and I'm very good at delegating tasks when I see strength and people and different abilities that they have. I'm very good at pulling out their strengths and using them because we can work together as a team and as a leader, I'm not there just to be a boss, but I'm there to also work with the people and that's another point that I want to say about um my leadership skills, I'm able to get down um in the trenches, so to speak with those under me and to really um work with them and like I said before to be an example to them instead of just bossing them around and a great skill that I also have as far as being a leader is being resourceful because sometimes things don't always work the way you want them to and you have to think of new and different ways to do things to accomplish the same task. So um resourcefulness is a great um skill that I have, I'm able to use things and make things work when one way doesn't work out. I had a situation where I was a director um in a pre k and the boiler kept going out and until we had the person to come fix that I had to keep going and resetting the boiler, so just being able to be resourceful and being flexible are also great qualities um and a leader and I also believe, oh my goodness, that being a leader, you can't be too high minded so that you don't understand the people next to you is um also building relationships with those who are under you as well um as far as being a leader because you really need to understand and know the people that you are working with or that you are leading so that you can know the best ways to lead them because everyone may not respond to you if you don't have a connection to them and kind of know um like I said before what their strengths are and kind of know How they respond to certain situations. So 1 um one tactic may be effective for one person, but it may not be effective for another person, so you really need to know and be in relationship with those around you to be able to effectively lead them. So as far as my leadership skills and abilities, I believe that pretty much sums up my skills and abilities, just being able to assess situations is also a good leadership skills. Being able to not always be so quick to offer solutions, but to sit back to observe, to learn to watch patterns, to watch habits and to watch how things operate. So you can better strategize and create plans to how to attack certain issues or to attack certain problems. So that's also a great skill that I have as being a leader and leadership is not always um wanting to be the ball so to be at the top, but it's also it's about working in unity with the people around you and showing leadership through your example, through your behavior, through your attitude, through your actions and people respond to that. If they feel that they can trust you, then that makes you a good leader not to believe that that's what makes me a good leader as well,",POSITIVE,0.9748,0.0006,0.0244,0.0002,728.0,LOW,5,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),11.76,1,0,0,"Master's degree (e.g. MA, MS, MEd)",Female,10.17846,10.48978,10.39535

I'm going to talk to you about my leadership capacities. So I'm a college professor. I have achieved full professor now for about maybe six years was when I was promoted to full professor. So I started out obviously as an assistant professor and then was promoted and got tenure and then finally made it to the top rank. So I think um you can guess that I probably demonstrate leadership capabilities to get here, but nonetheless I'm going to run through some of the things that I have done that I think really demonstrate some of my strengths. So of course as a professor, I am in front of the classroom, right? So I'm leading a class uh you know, two days a week and I have been, you know, except for the times that I have been on sabbatical, I teach a large lecture course, which means, you know, being the leader in front of 100 students write 100 undergraduate students, freshmen and sophomores. Obviously I also have taking the lead on some curriculum. I was instrumental in helping us revise our research methods sequence, I developed and helped co teach the first uh section of that three course sequence. So I've also demonstrated demonstrated some leadership skills there. But I think my most substantial leadership skill demonstration has come in terms of service. So I co chaired the committee that put together an entirely new college at my current university, we put together at College of Health and we had to be particularly innovative because we were not going to have a school of medicine. So we had to think outside the box and how to add that to the university in such a way that um that did not require a medical school. And I think that was an extremely successful endeavor by the way, that was also the first time that I ever had to manage what I would consider to be more difficult characters. Because some of the members of the provost put on the committee definitely had very different ideas than others in terms of how they envisioned this new college and were often very self centered and wanted, you know, their own type of research represented in the College of Health. So it was an interesting experience both to lead the committee and to um and to to learn to manage uh you know, an an an an interesting but creative and ultimately very competent cast of characters. And we were successful. The new College of Health opened last year despite the pandemic and I'm really proud of the way it came out. The second leadership role that I had. The demonstrated uh leaders or the yeah, the second service role that I had that demonstrated leadership was when I charged the tenure committee. So I was on the tenure committee, I was elected to the tenure committee for for three years and we charity it at the time that the dean asked us to revise our tenure procedures basically. So the chair of the promotion committee who also ended up being in my department and I spearheaded those changes and we worked on some more visions. We brought them to the chairs, we took them to the college faculty meeting. We ultimately um you know, had an open discussion at the college faculty meeting that we lead and those revisions that we made in terms of clarifying some of the tenure criteria were also accepted. Finally, of course, I can't get out of here without mentioning that. I also write, take leadership in terms of my research. But that's um when that's pretty obvious, I'm at a research school and I lead a big lab. I have several graduate students that I direct their research on. I also have a huge team of undergraduates that help us collect data. We are not observation early based research lab. You know, I um, I oversee the graduate students, I train them and they train and often supervised the undergraduates, although I do some of that as well. And you know, I take the lead on the research questions, I take the lead on the grants, I take the lead on the manuscripts that come out of all of those things. So, Um I think that's an easy one and one that, you know, many, many full professors would have in terms of leadership potential. So that's um that's why I think you should hire me.

Um As as a manager, I was responsible for the training and skills development of my juniors um in particular making sure that those that were coming straight out of college or university, we're going to grow and develop in our team to um progress, have a have a career progression with us. Obviously we want, if we want to train them we want to keep them those skills that we're developing in our team and in the long term if we can work them into the team where they fit and are happy um That that investment of our our time and money in them um brings a the role fulfillment at the higher levels makes it much easier to to recruit from within our company. People who are already familiar with our techniques are ethos, our client base and are happy then mentoring the younger recruits as they come up as a manager. I tried very much not to be um intimidating people because you don't get the best out of people when they're intimidated when they're scared for their job, worried about reprimands, you get the most out of people when they when they feel fulfilled, when they feel like they're valued when they feel like they are taking part in a team and fulfilling a valuable role within our group and that we've had some that come in that are lacking in certain areas and we organized the training in house or or an external um institutions to bring them up to speed, make sure that they are able to complete the role that they have been assigned. Um We want to inspire and encourage them to make the best out of them. Um We want to make sure that we've got the right skills in the team, the right balance of skills, we can have the best people, but if they were all skilled in one area then our team is not well rounded, so making sure that people's interests varied within within the different roles. So we don't just have um you know, a whole stack of database people because then our front hands aren't going to get done properly. Um So making sure that we have uh a broad a broad selection of skills but that those skills are being encouraged and developed because of my previous experience at the lower areas, I'm perfectly willing to get hands on, get in there, get sat down next to them, help them through, give them the encouragement and the guidance while being aware that I can't coddle them. Uh One of the things with management is that you sometimes have to make hard decisions. And while we I would always try and encourage and train with in house. If someone isn't completing their role and is unwilling or unable to complete their role, I would have to look at moving their position or replacing them. Management have to take the hard decisions.

Um which shows my commitment and you know, dog in Australia. I got I got the degree and the Master's. I'm skilled in Excel and word. I've got excellent typing skills. I spent several years working designing and building reports for a large telecoms company so I can find my way around report and I know when to dig deeper and ask questions. I'm a hard worker. I'm always ready to put the extra hours and if needed and I can work flexibly whether office based or home. I've always been one for holding regular team meetings, especially for any, if there's any office moves or all changes to office procedures. Um and I've always been happy to take on people's suggestions and look at people's complaints or look into people's objections rather because I find it it's better if it's a collaborative effort, don't run away from hard conversations escorting people out of the building and have brought problems to light that have resulted in people losing their jobs. Um I've regularly given people feedback and it's it's great to praise people and it's a lovely experience, but sometimes it's not possible and you have to have really difficult conversations with people, but I face them head on and I've never shied away from having a you know difficult conversation. Um jobs in the past I've worked with call center managers to optimize agent shifts to match core patterns. So the core center was fully staffed at all times, especially busy times and we didn't have lots of abandoned calls. So design shifts for the agents um obviously mostly fit into the busy periods but also taking into account their needs as far as possible if they sort of didn't want to work on a thursday afternoon or whatever. Have helped bring in new computer systems and run training sessions then acted as the office point of contact for subsequent queries. I've worked on lots of different roles, coding, reporting analyst, admin, support financial analyst. So I have lots of experience and knowledge in different jobs of run presentations. I have a strong work ethic If I need to be up at 5:00 because of the crisis and I've got to deal with then I'll be there but then I'll get it fixed. So it doesn't happen again I'm quiet, I don't have a strong personality, I listen to people and I get along with people of all ages discrete in another of my roles. I typed all the managers, senior managers reports on management and I was known for not divulging the contents to anyone trustworthy, trusted colleague with lots to offer any leadership.

So I think I'm going to go through a little of my previous experience of being a manager. I'm currently in a position where I managed a small team, um Tony four of us at the moment and it's been that way for a while, it's quite a close knit team. We've worked together for many years now, uh and I think I'll just go through sort of how I ended up in that position and how my employees um sort of ended up in that position as well. So I was taken on as a entry level employee in this particular post and wasn't intending really to be a management part of the management team at this company. But after I'd worked there for around six months, it became apparent that my skills were someone not being utilized and um I was promoted. So I was promoted over a another member of the team. They were experienced in their post and were quite happy to remain in that post. And so we we have a very good working relationship, get along very well and I don't think there was any particular difficulty with me being promoted to a managerial position over them and also our team expanded at this point, so we took on a train Who was only 16 at the time. And so I'm sure she can understand there were some challenges with having a very young person coming into post who hadn't hadn't ever actually worked in any position in any company before. And the the world management challenges there. We had to work with that person because they were quite, quite poor attendance and sort of timings and things to begin with. They also needed to learn a lot about a very new task to them, something they've never done before. And also a working environment which has never worked in before. My particular management style is very relaxed and open. Always sort of had an open door policy with all all staff have them come in and talk to me if I've got any problems you try and go through them, try and fix them, see if we've got to work around something that so if we can work in a way that works better for them. But obviously while the work that needs to be done is still done and while company policies are still adhered to, but we will try and find a communal way through something that works for everybody. Uh huh. But if that isn't something that can be done, I'm I'm fully able to follow disciplinary procedures and if that's necessary, it's not my preference, obviously I don't think it's any manager's preference to have to do that, but that is something that I can do um I have previous experience in the past of working with youth offenders and people with That was suffering from long term unemployment was working in um 3rd sex to. And we took on sort of a whole batch of um young people that that had quite a lot of problems. And I've got a huge amount of experience of dealing with very very difficult management situations because of that. Um So my management is primarily people focused um managing personality conflicts difficulty again with attendance sometimes with we had drug abuse issues within that particular cohort. And also the fact that there were some of them were long term unemployed in the various reasons why why that was there was mental health issues involved. And so I think that that's all played into my management's data which is very much a cohesive. I try to find a find a way through that works for everybody, but if it's not working it's not working. And there's plenty of procedures and sort of all that needs to be followed as well. So I'm very very good at managing that that that type of side of things. And I think I'm just also quite in an open personality. I get on well with my own with my subordinates and we all you know, we do the work together if there's something that's a difficult task that people are struggling on, we try and assign it to the people that are best at that or you know people need more help which I can do that, that's not a problem.

Um In terms of my management skills, I've been managing The team of 16 up to 16 different individuals now since 2014. So for eight years, I tend to have a consultative management style, so it's not dictatorial. I'd much rather seek the opinion of my team members, explain to them the rationale behind any changes. Um I'm keen on ensuring that performance is met and dealing with any performance issues as and when they arise. Um The team have generally given good feedback that they'd rather get critical or constructive feedback as and when it's needed so that they can actually address any issues with staff performance. Um They'd prefer that than being worried that they can't improve because they're not a word that there needs to be improvement or worried that people are talking about them behind their back. At least if you explain to them your expectations of them in their role versus what they're delivering at that moment in time, they have the opportunity to address that and you can work together with them in order to identify the relevant resources, training, and support that they may need to actually get to that point in their career. Similarly, if somebody is doing really well, it's critical that you actually give them that feedback. Um It's one of the cheapest things that you can do for a member of staff is give them feedback, but it has such a major impact on their work performance and it doesn't cost you anything to do to say thank you and to actually refer to things on a situational basis, you did a really good job of that client presentation and on the back of that, the clients come back and they want us to do additional work that's all on you.

It's meant that they've felt supported and it puts the company in a really good light. You didn't have to do that, but it is very much appreciated by your teammates and management. Being open and honest. It helps build mutual trust between the manager um and the direct reports that that report into you. Um I think good communication has to be key when you're managing a team of individuals, recognizing that people should be treated fairly and consistently while also acknowledging that everybody is different. We have different learning styles, different working styles, every personality is different. So while somebody maybe very studious, want to keep their head down, just want to know what needs to be done when it needs to be done by and then left to get on with it. Other team members may want more support, discussion, team involvement to make them feel valued, whereas the other team members might just want to be left alone to get on with it. So it's important that you get to know the strengths and the weaknesses of your team play to them, but at the same time give everybody a fair and consistent opportunity to work on to have the same opportunities, whether that be in project management, it being training courses? No, it is communication is key. Um, I tend to be very honest, if my team want my opinion, I will give them my opinion. They may not always like it, but I find that honesty is always the best policy. Um, and my team know that I'll be honest with them. It's helped build trust and they know that if they need my support, they've got it.

During my time here, I've worked with teaching assistants with newly qualified teachers and with more experienced teachers. I have so far in my career been a mentor for newly qualified teachers. I have implemented a scheme for teaching assistance to to further their own careers. They now have regular performance management meetings where they can discuss any further professional development that they wish to undertake.

Um an example of this was instead of changing everybody's timetable round, my suggestion was well why don't we just move? We had an issue with singing assembly, for example, why don't we just move the day that we sing from a friday, which is what it was always on a friday to a different day of the week instead of moving everybody's timetable round, Some people missing out to me, that was the obvious answer, just because something has been done that way for many years doesn't mean that that's the only way it can happen. We have to move on, we have to adapt. If it doesn't work, it doesn't work, we'll go back to it the following year, but let's try it and actually we've carried on with that a new way of doing things for the last few years.

H. Just for the purposes of this video. Um I currently work as a laboratory and phenotype ng technician. Um But I want to talk about my personal skills that I would bring to the position of the manager within this area and I'm approachable and I'd like to keep communication open with coworkers. Which includes making an effort at all times to personally know them as well as getting to know why they're in their jobs. What their general career progression that they're hoping for Is are there any particular personal goals they have whilst working wherever I could help help them to achieve? Um Very flexible in my approach to working that includes working out of hours if required, doing overtime if required. But also being flexible in how I think work should be done and being open to suggestions from co workers as to how we can improve on the process and become more efficient. How we can cut down on time it takes to make a process happen and how to perform things that for example produce better results, more reliable results and more precise results if possible. Um I've worked on a shift system before, so I've done nights on a 24/7 shift shift system with systems that look like three days or three days off sort of thing. Um Quite a results driven individual say one of the jobs that have worked in previously which was in a lighthouse laboratory was a high free pit environment, which meant that numbers counted one of the systems they actually had there was that they would measure different teams performances. Um just to see which team managed to produce more results across a certain shifts. Um So I have experienced in a lighthouse laboratory for covid testing and in a phoenix helping and laboratory routine, which are currently working now. And I've worked as a supervisor in a restaurant before, I'm just going to talk about how each bit of experience has contributed to how well I would work as a manager myself. Um When I worked as a supervisor, I would do a lot of scheduling and time tabling at the restaurant. So that would include doing the timetable and working out how many people we needed per shift, but also ranging if that would work for those employees or if people needed time off and things like that. Um Which leads into creating a team environment at my workplace, which goes back to the personal skills that I was talking about, where I was saying about how I like to be approachable and I like to make an effort with the people that I work with and obviously that's incredibly important as a supervisor and with managing teams. Um The other thing I did as a supervisor was liaise with suppliers, so that would be both booking suppliers into delivery slots in our bays. Um It would be talking about issues if, say a supplier couldn't supply a certain item to us if there were substitution if there was any way we could fix it or if the delivery was late, what we could do about him, these sorts of things um I would also routinely be called in to deal with customers that maybe you weren't having the best experience because they had different expectations of what a restaurant visits should involve and that could be anything from expecting a different level of customer service. Um Just to expecting their food to be cooked in a different way. And managing those sorts of issues with customers meant that um all customers would leave even with their expectations being met or with having a discussion with me about why those expectations weren't met and what we could do to improve the experience of it in general. Um One of the other jobs but I mentioned previously. So I worked in a lighthouse labs as an associate practitioner I learned. So the experiences that that gave me in a lab environment is that I learned in depth the pre PcR and post PcR components of working in alarm which translates working outside of the PcR lab into general lab. Workers for pre analytical analytical and post analytical phases And obviously most of those areas are separated so that people will work in the pre analytical area. The analyst square or the post analyst square area or some labs you work in where all of those areas are combined. So having the experience of working and loves with those different layouts is quite important to move into any other lab.",NEUTRAL,0.454,0.002,0.5436,0.0004,778.0,LOW,5,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),9.799999,1,0,0,"Bachelor's degree (e.g. BA, BS)",Female,8.980291,9.297439,9.27107

I really feel that I am a natural leader. I've thought this for a long time, I am 25 now. Um but even from a young age, I always saw myself as a natural leader, I do have a younger brother and I think especially when I was in elementary and middle school, I kind of found myself, you know teaching him, things showing him around um just kind of trying to help him out in any way I can and I really enjoyed that. Um I also wanted to mention that I am a teacher right now. Um this is my third year teaching and I also think that's kind of where my love for teaching came in as well, so I really think teaching and um leading others kind of go hand in hand and I think I've had a passion for both throughout my entire life and then fast forward to high school, I was very involved in high school, I was a part of many different organizations. One that I was really involved in was the rotary interact club throughout this organization. We did a lot of community service. Um we had meetings um pretty much every day um during the school week um and during my sophomore year I was actually invited to attend a summer leadership camp um and that was because I was one of the students with the most amount of hours and really we didn't um I have to have that many hours, I just really enjoyed being involved in my community and helping others out and just doing what I could. Um you know, I enjoyed working with the other students in my organization, but I really like to go into the camp and I was actually awarded a small scholarship as well from that experience and throughout that camp I got to work with other students throughout the state. Um we were able to hear from a lot of different speakers, um work together on projects and things like that. So I definitely think that that helped my leadership skills and then during my senior year of high school, I was the president of Key Club and I worked with um the other people in the office of like the vice president, the secretary treasurer, um to plan meetings, banquets, um decide what kind of community service we wanted to do as well. So I really think in high school that was a time where I really worked on building those leadership skills and I really enjoyed those things that I was involved in. I was also a member of teacher cadet. Um this was a program that would prepare you to go into education after high school and I was pretty certain that I wanted to be a teacher and throughout that I kind of got to go to a local elementary schools, do some observations, teach a couple of lessons. Um, I do think that also helps build those leadership skills. Um I was also in beta club, a recycling club and a couple other things. Okay. And then also when I was in high school I had a job, I worked at a local fast food restaurant. Um I did enjoy my time there and I also trained others. So I do think that my manager saw me as a leader since I was given the opportunity to train new workers and I really enjoyed that. I really enjoy working with others and helping them out, especially when they are new to something. I just really enjoyed that. Um fast forward to college. I was in a program called Teaching Fellows. Now this is something that it's in my state that I had to apply in high school to be accepted into and this was a great opportunity. I was involved all four years of college and we got to um have many professional development experiences. We also did some community service throughout the um, this organization and my senior year, I actually was a co court representative, this was a leadership role where I would plan meetings for my um other classmates um and we would kind of all discuss, you know what kind of projects we wanted to work on that semester or what kind of community service we wanted to do and things like that and I really enjoyed holding that position. Fast forward to now. I am now a third year teacher and you know, just throughout my career I definitely think I have to have a lot of leadership abilities because I am leading Children every day. Um just a few things about me, my principal has said that I am very professional, I'm very self motivated and I'm a great team player, I love um working as a team, hearing what others have to say, I think that is so valuable and really, even as a leader you are always learning. So I think that's a very important trait to have and then a couple other things, I'm very goal oriented, I worked very hard and to reach my goals and I think that's very important to make sure you're always working towards something. And lastly I'm creative, I like um to solve problems and I think that's what would make me a great fit for this position.

Um it's important to have good communication with your team and to involve your entire team in the decision making process and empower your team to get things done, like get them all, get them motivated to get the project completed. I also think a very important thing is to be aware of your team, how they're doing at the moment, what's going on with them, allow them whatever you can work with them so that they have a good work and work, help them balance their personal life and their work life. Um okay, being able to adapt to changing circumstances is really important not to be so set in your ways that um, you can't think things differently.

It's important to foster new ideas and to foster work environment where new ideas are going to be accepted and considered so that people will share what they're thinking instead of holding it back and just going with the way things already are.

One of the most important attributes I believe for a leader is the ability to listen and listening is not just hearing what the other person is saying, but it's also the ability to hear and put into action what the other person, your employees saying by this. I mean implementing reasonable requests um that can help benefit your employer and your overall team. For example if somebody comes to you at short notice having as well and your leave um and they have shown quite a high high work ethic and have been doing really well in response to that, it's reasonable to grant that although it may be short notice in doing this, you can demonstrate compassion, compassionate response towards your employee. Um This also means they're more willing to ask you for things going forward because they know that they can be heard um where the where the request is proportionate. A good leader is also able to demonstrate action through um examples by by doing as well. So by this I mean you are able to help your colleagues um your employees where they may be struggling in doing so you're showing that you're willing to get involved um and that you have time um to to help other individuals and not necessarily just task focused on your your managerial stuff if it may be the case. Another way um A leader shows good skills is to incentivize others by this, you are able to offer a reward system to other individuals. You can do this through either weekly or monthly rewards of voucher. um um it could be through money or tokens by this year, showing that you recognize that people have gone above and beyond, You've recognized that other people are putting more effort. You recognize that people are sincerely wanting to give back to the company in various different ways. This not also helps that person feel good about what they're doing. It helps encourage others to think if I want a reward system, there is a better way I can work to also get that as well. This can create a slight competition between individuals, which is not necessarily a bad thing um when it is focused on doing the work accurately appropriately into a high standard um where it may be um um not constructive is if this is creating friction between the team and a good leader is able to foresee those things and have these discussions beforehand before anything happens. A good leader is also able to understand their employees by this. I mean I foster an open door policy where individuals can come and speak to me um and let their concerns be known. Um showing that again, I have time to listen and to care and to demonstrate compassion for the people that I'm working with because people are complex um and people have various different needs by doing this, you create a better work environment and a better work environment increases productivity. I would also like to maximize on the strength um of my employees. By this, I mean retraining um supporting individuals to go through either workshops or conferences. Conferences buy up skilling your your team, what you're doing is getting a better output of performance. It also makes it quite difficult um from an HR perspective for individual um um limited candidates to get through. So by this there's a positive, higher percentage of people with a higher skill set that will join the team because the team is working above and beyond positive statements is also a really good attribute of a team leader to show that people are validated, to show that people are seen and recognized um for their service to the company um and that they are integral to the part of its structure.",POSITIVE,0.8771,0.0007,0.121,0.0013,651.0,LOW,6,96.0,1.0,Using only (2),11.08,1,0,0,"Bachelor's degree (e.g. BA, BS)",Female,8.244889,8.574565,8.694244

I have worked on a variety of different talent management um programs, apprenticeships um and statutory and mandatory training provision with a whole lot of learning interventions, my skills as a leader, I think one of the first skills is that I'm a strategic leader, I focus on aligning business needs um as well as departmental needs, I focus on ensuring that what we have to do as a department and developing staff very much aligns with the strategic goals of the organization. I work, I'm an inclusive leader, so I work with, I ensure that I work with and collaborate with a lot of different stakeholders within the organization and outside of the organization, I focus on ensuring that I lead a variety of projects, so I'm a good role model as well. Um so I focused on leading a variety of projects and being a role model for all of the staff that I language, I focus on, well being, well being, is a very big aspect of my leadership skills. I ensure that within well being, I focus on my team um and the wider organization and ensuring that if we have a team that is well looked after, we will have an efficient team moving forward and if if the human resource within an organization feel as though they come first, I believe that that would ensure that they Also feel as though they can put the organization 1st. So I tried to be a role model in focusing on well being. I tried to ensure that my team collaborate as I've mentioned, I also focus a lot on ensuring that development of key stakeholder management um key states, developing those key stakeholder relationships within and externally. Um I also focus on personal factors. So one of the key skills is looking not only within the organization but also um Externally so what um what issues or things that are going on outside? So for instance, environmentally, what are the new things going on? Environmentally that we need to be looking at as an organization and focusing on those issues and how that will then help us to strategize for the future and look at the things that we require for the future. Um I will also focus on developing new innovative ideas and programs for leadership development for talent development and ensuring that at the heart of it all people that we work with us come first, the people that work with us feel as though they are fully supported and their development is a priority for everything that we do. Um So overall, my leadership skills focus on inclusivity, um ensuring that people from diverse backgrounds from diverse backgrounds and experiences inclusivity of the mind, inclusivity with regards to protected characteristics are all included um and I also focused on collaboration being a strategic leader and I also focus on stakeholder management and having an awareness of external pesto factors that will impact the strategy of any organization that we moved into.

So this is me letting you know why I have leadership qualities, the abilities I also have within the working environment and why I should be considered for the managerial role. So first let me start with the leadership qualities that I think I've shown throughout my life. So consider this me telling you parts of my CV that fit into this category of leadership qualities. So I've worked in a variety of roles often within childcare positions. Now the first area where I worked was within private nurseries and in private nurseries there's quite a large turnover of staff and where I really found leadership qualities showing in myself in that position was that I really, really worked hard on making sure that new starts, we're up to scratch on what to do in the room so that they felt confident and we're also taking part well throughout the working day. So by that I mean checking in with them that they had the knowledge and understanding required to take part in the tasks and take care of the Children correctly. But also making sure that they were able to express themselves if they had ideas or things that they wanted to try. That it was an environment where other staff felt able to speak up. So I think that really shows leadership because it's not about people following every rule that I set or working every way that I set, it's about all of us working together towards the one common goal and by encouraging people to know that they can participate and really that their views are welcomed, that that means that everybody is working to their highest ability. So I think that's part of leadership, making sure that people want to come to talk to you if they have problems but also that they are contributing. So other areas I think within leadership would be personal reviews, so personal reviews to make sure people are meeting their aims within the working day as well and working towards things that they think are important, such as further education. For example, the abilities that I really think would meet this manager role is that I am calm and conscientious. I'm not somebody that's easily ruffled. So I think that definitely is what is required in the manager I don't think and we can all think of them angry managers we've had in the past, it doesn't inspire anybody to do their best work. The working day should be enjoyable as possible for everyone. Also I would say I'm intelligent if there's problems that need solved. I'm happy to think about it and want to think about it because I take pride in my work and I would want everything to be working to its highest degree possible without people becoming in a stressful environment. So good enough is good enough if we're all trying our best, I'm definitely willing also to get stuck in. So although this is for a manager's position, if there is a more basic role that day that needs filled in due to sickness or other issues then I think that's part of being a manager able to step into any role required during that day, which means that the ship is being stared correctly. So as I say, I feel I am really responsible and trustworthy and that I would show such pride in my work that I would want everything to be going well and everybody in the organization to be feeling comfortable, motivated in trying their best as well. So that's really important to me. So as I say, I've started in private nurseries before then moving on to the retail environment and in that way that showed ways in which being a leader can be, be around being calm around customers that may be unhappy or may have queries that take some time to sort out. So I think being a manager is about inspiring your staff and also helping and being a good first face to the customers in your role as well. I think that's shown many qualities required him as a leader, the main one being calm and ready to listen to others and really just always with a can do attitude, that's the most important thing. There is a solution to every problem and I'm happy to encourage others to find the solutions as well. Thanks very much for your time today.

I have been in a leadership role for the past six or so years and within that time I have been leading teams to great success. I strongly believe that out of all the videos that you will watch, that you will think that I am the best for this leadership role. So I have no doubt that you will see lots of videos from people who claim that they are the best for this role. Um I actually think you'll hear from a lot of people who are great bosses, I think they'll say they're very good at directing employees, commanding respect, giving authority, but actually what I think you want is a great leader. So someone that develops employees and their respect and makes people feel really valued and I strongly believe that I am that leader that you are looking for. So firstly I believe that I have very high emotional intelligence and I think that is so important in a leader. Um I think I'm very good at understanding where the strengths are in my employees and ensuring that people perform to the best of their ability. So one of the things that I like to do first when I take over a project, is just knowing the strengths and weaknesses of everyone that's in my team and I think this is really effective to help manage the outcome of the team. I think if you know where people's strengths and weaknesses are, you can really make sure that they shine and you can get the best out of people which ultimately deliver success on projects. I'm a risk taker, I'm not afraid to make hard decisions when they need to be made and I accept that I can sometimes be wrong and I think that does make me a very successful leader, both in my professional and my personal life. I also think that you can't be a good leader if you don't have faith in your beliefs and I think you have to really be clear when you articulate those to the rest of your team. I think I'm a very good communicator. I think I do articulate my idea as well and I feel that one of my strengths is igniting passion amongst my employees and finding a way to motivate and excite them. I also mentioned earlier that it's not about commanding respect but about earning it and I've got really strong experience in building relationships with my team and showing my team respect and empathy and I think that's really crucial to a leadership role. And I also aspire to be the kind of leader that really pushes people to do their very best and I like to still make people feel safe, I really like to catch people winning. And that's something that I learned from a really good leader that I've been learning from in my current role. Um I think whenever you see one of your employees doing something great, you should really encourage that and really, really celebrate people's success all in all. I think that I am the best choice for this leadership position. I'm not only really experienced in a leadership role, I've delivered many successful projects and really helped to develop the staff that have been underneath me. Ultimately, though, I think I'm honest, I care about people. As I mentioned, I think I've got really high emotional intelligence and I'm really capable of understanding the people within my team and getting the best out of the people in my team and I think that you would find a very passionate and dedicated person within me and I really hope that you picked me for this leadership role.

My area of expertise is instructional leadership within the realm of education. First of all, I believe my 10 years of experience in leading various managerial positions provides me with a unique perspective in leading um any type of team, an instructional leadership. And it's allowed me to build a variety of tools, sort of tool box to become an effective manager when you're working with a diverse team, it's necessary to have different skills and to understand which skills work with your team and which skills do not. Second, I have extensive education including a doctorate degree and instructional leadership. That degree provided me with the theory behind managerial skills and leading teams and it also gave me a chance to put those into practice in a very wide range of situations and it let me practice with those skills from my toolbox to lead diverse teams. Each team is different and each team member has different skills and areas that they excel in or need more help. 3rd, I've got excellent organizational skills, I think those skills allow me to provide an example, provide a mentor so that team members can see how an effective leader should work and it should build fostered relationships that would allow for productive outcomes to solve any problem. Next. I also believe that a good leader in a managerial position needs to understand all roles that are expected of supervised employees. That means getting your hands dirty, that means doing the jobs that you are going to be delegating your other employees to do. It also builds camaraderie between yourself and your employees. I think that allows you to build a lasting team relationship and together that contributes to excellent outcomes when it comes to solving problems as a team. Another skill and ability I have is excellent listening and compromising skills with listening skills. It's important to provide active listening, it's not about just listening to what you were, you're employees are trying to say to you, it's about hearing what they're saying and reflecting upon it back so that their contributions can be brought into the problem that you're trying to solve. And that also leads to compromising skills. Power trips by leaders do nothing to foster those relationships and often impede um the creation of a good team and it leads to a negative manager. So by having good compromising skills, I believe that I'm able to help foster a team that is going to work together and get along well and solve whatever the problem that we're facing. Finally, I've learned to observe and incorporate skills from many of my previous mentors and that contributes to continuous growth in the areas of leadership skills and abilities. A good leader has to be able to keep up with, what's going on in the world of leadership and by continuing to grow my own skills. I believe I would foster good relationships and good outcomes with my employees.",POSITIVE,0.7718,0.0003,0.2277,0.0002,530.0,MED,8,94.0,1.0,Using only (2),11.86,1,0,0,"Bachelor's degree (e.g. BA, BS)",Female,7.156667,7.508186,8.463731

And starting first with the business skills. So that is not just having your eye on the work that's on your desk and also having a look at business needs. So are your team working within the right policies and procedures and regulations? If your business is regulated, are you able to produce the work that you need to that moment? Do you have the right people and then having an eye on work coming in? Do you have the right people there to be able to produce that work going forward? And do you need new people? Do you have the training that you need? Making sure that the product that you are um marketing and I'm supposed to the market but your service product or actual physical product is something that's attractive to the market. So that's financially it is profitable. It's enough to pay your staff to pay your overheads and actually make a profit at the end of the day, it's attractive. Do do clients, you're able to grow that product or grow the market within which you are, you're offering that product um on the client skill set, the ability to make a client feel valued to take the time to understand their business to understand what synergies that there might be between your business and there's you may be offering product a but if you took the time to speak to them and understand the actually product be that we offer but be really good for them. Having an understanding of their business and talking to them about it would allow you to naturally talk about product p and to sell yourself and your team and the product that you are producing. Also the ability to make sure that you are able to market to new clients. It's very important and making sure that you're team, be it the team making the products or they support staff around those teams that they're all highly motivated in order to be able to make that client feel valued. Um So then moving on to the people skills and is is so important. People skills feed into the client skills as well. Um but you need to be personable, approachable as a leader, you need the ability to motivate your staff to perform and then to perform well. So they need to have clear goals and expectations. Um That needs to be communicated to all your team at all different levels. You need the ability to critique where were needed in a way that doesn't demotivated and you need to be able to deal with difficult situations and difficult conversations calmly and confidently and and also to have a to make sure your staff are motivated by the right the right salary, the right benefits and also the ability to see a clear career path and create progression. Making sure they have the right training being cool, calm, hand on the steering wheel essentially. So in summary, three main skills required people skills, business skills and clients skills. And without one of those, I do not think it's possible to be good. All round manager. All leader.

First of all I possess good communication skills. I believe in talking to people seeing how they're feeling and making sure that they know are the important things that they need to know to be successful. I believe that I have empathy. I want to make sure that the people that work for me that I lead would be happy would know what I expect of them. But I would also want to make sure that that we're kind so that we get the best out of the staff. I'm passionate. I feel that I would bring that to the role because I want the best for the company and I believe using my skills, I'd be able to help people to have that I feel that I'm honest. I believe that to get the best out of people, you need to make sure that they know where they stand and you tell them what they need to know may not always be what they want to hear. But they need to know what is, what is what I think you have to be motivating as well. And I believe that I do have motivation skills. Again, it's important to tell people what you want from them, how they can achieve it and what the end of that will be. So you need to tell them how they're the input will improve the company and ensure that they are motivated. Mm hmm I feel that I can help to inspire loyalty. Mhm I think by being fair to people, they are going to be encouraged to be loyal to you. Yeah. Mm hmm, transparency. I I feel is another aspect that is really important that I possess people need to know where they stand. They want to know that what you're telling them is the truth. If it's not good news, then they still need to know that. But I think transparency is definitely an important feature of being a leader. And I do feel that I have that Commitment is another one. I'm again, as I said passionate about this company, I am committed to it and I want, I want the best for it. And I do certainly believe that that is an important feature of being a good leader. I'm not afraid to delegate. I can't take on everything I have to trust my staff which is again, something important so that I am inspiring them and they know that I believe in them. So I really do think that it's important to, to empower the staff. And I do feel that I can do this okay. You need to have courage as well. And I do believe that I possess courage.

I feel like I am really qualified for this as I have worked with this organization now for seven years and I have a lot of experience prior to coming here with managing people. I feel like aside from just the managerial experience that I have, I have shown the commitment to our A facility in our business by being here for the last seven years. I feel like I am part of a business family that I absolutely love and can see myself being here very much long term. Some of the managerial aspects that I bring to the table or that I have been a supervisor to over 20 people at a time with zero complaints by those people to any kind of superior. I feel like I have a lot of experience in dealing with difficult situations, but dealing with them in a way where we can work together in order to come up with a solution. I advocate for employees to try and solve problems on their own. But I also also always have an open door policy where if an employee just feels like they maybe even need to discuss with me what we might be able to do together. I'm really open to that and I never want my employees to feel like they are out there on their own and that they don't have somebody to go to. I am a very organized person. I definitely start out every day and end every day making sure that all of my ducks are in a row and that everything is organized. I don't ever want to come across as somebody who is disorganized. I don't ever want to come across as somebody who doesn't have the best interest of both the organization and my employees at at heart and that is why I feel like organization is such a key thing for me because if you don't have everything in in line then sometimes you can come across as very scattered and that not only you don't care but also that you maybe aren't capable of handling some of the things that might come up in the job again, I feel very dedicated to the organization as a whole, but I also feel very dedicated to helping the organization to grow and I feel it in order to grow. We oftentimes need to foster not only growth from uh, the outside but also growth from within. I feel like I would really welcome the opportunity to be one of the people that gets to grow in my position and move on from being just a staff member um, which I have loved doing, but also growing into a new position with the organization and on top of that, I would love to give other employees who will be reporting to me if I get this position to also have that opportunity to grow. I think that again from my prior experience, I often advocated and I often um try to encourage my employees to try and move forward within the organization, even though we do our best to hire people that we know will do good at the job that we are hiring for. I think that it's also important to hire people that you know will grow into the positions of management and upper management down the road. There are definitely two different types of people when it comes to that some people are more than happy to start at an entry level and stay there and that's great. But then other people really can move into those managerial roles, which is something that I feel that I am made for and that others hopefully are made for as well. And I think that that is something that is key to the growth of an organization because you are always going to have people who are retiring, who are moving on and you need people to fill those shoes and you need people who are um not only willing but also trained to do that. And again, I feel like that is something that I bring to the table is the ability to find that talent and to foster that talent in people in closing, I just really want to tell you that, I think that the reason that I would be the best candidate for a managerial position within this organization is that I want to see this company succeed and I think that I am a great leader. I lead by example, but I also lead by caring about what I'm doing and about the people around me.

Um so you have asked me, what do I think it means to be a good manager um and and what our leadership skills, so I want to go back a little bit and just talk about some of the managers I've had and how they've impacted me. My very first job was a gentleman who was in school full time, getting his graduate degree while running a business and then successfully finished school and bought the business. So I got to work from him as a, as a manager and as an owner and was with him for many years and one of the, I think the most important things I learned from him was, you know, was the the idea that, you know, kind of basically you you'd never ask somebody to do something, you wouldn't do yourself and something that they haven't seen you done before or do before. Um and that to me is is one of the most important things that to be a manager and have leadership, you actually have to lead, you don't tell you do show by example, show that you're part of the team that you support their efforts as much as um you know, they support yours. Um and a lot of other, you know hard work and perseverance and and those types of things, I think modeling, I learned from him really modeling modeling the behavior and he could be a jerk sometimes and I'd see how the whole staff would react and so you know what not to my, you know, the way to maybe keep yourself in check to, you know, take a minute walk away if you need to form a situation. Um you know, really kind of try to keep a level head in all situations. Um moving on to my next position, um it was a much higher level position with, it was actually my, my start in my current um industry um that I'm still in now after, I think 19 years, so um and had a couple of different managers that came through one extremely ineffective and um I learned a lot from that experience because he was ineffective in that he did not support his team. He didn't have our backs. Um and he often would undercut us. Um if it, if he felt it made himself look better, he did not last long and rightfully so because many of the team members were actually actively looking for other positions because we did not want to work with him anymore. We didn't feel um we didn't feel that, you know, there was a future for us here. So luckily we had a new, you know, a new a new director come in. He really built back our team spirit or, you know, brought us together and uh I think that's one of the other things is I I learned in that position was being able to look at people's differences and find common ground not only between myself and the people I managed, but also between team members. There was a lot of discord between a couple of team members and he was able to um, find ways to get those team members to work together to a successful conclusions that made them better team members in the future. He, he allowed them, you know, to work on projects together. And when those were successful, they felt more bonded and it worked out very well. Um, and that was, I think that was another lesson I learned there. So I would say from my, my leadership style, I'm very people oriented and first and foremost, I want to make sure that my team is, is happy and feels appreciated and cared for. Um, you know, in a, you know, cared for in the, in the business sense because I think a happy team and a, um, a well rewarded and recognized team is going to be a productive team. Um, financially, you know responsible as well. And I think one of the things that, you know, when we have, we have projects brought to our attention vendors that we want to hire trips that we want to do sales missions, things like that. And, and we will, we'll often talk about the financials, the economics of it and I make sure that they understand, you know, what's expected of us, what we need to meet, where we need to, you know, what metrics we need to hit. Um, you know, we say we don't use me search, we use research. So show us the facts. And if you can make your case, um, then we'll give it a try if it if it's, you know, if it meets our metrics and the things that we need. So while I'm, you know, very much um, on the human capital, I guess as a way to put it, I'm very much aware of of the value that my team has. The economics always plays a part in the back of our mind, as well as, um, social responsibility, corporate responsibility. Uh, you know, and, and ultimately what are what are our company's goals and what is the right thing? So my leadership, that's my leadership style.

I've been asked to talk about my leadership skills and qualities um and my experiences with all of those things. So let me first start by saying um a little bit about who I am and what qualities I think would help me to be in a managing position. So um I am a PhD student, I'm in my second year and I think when people hear that you're a researcher and a student, you're still at that at that level, it can sound like you're the one being led rather than being the leader, but I think this is actually very untrue because doing a huge research project like a PhD requires a lot of leadership because you are the only guiding yourself and you're leading yourself through this process, but often at times you are asked to support lots of people around you to prove that you can access that level or that higher ability. Um So some examples of that would be, I have been asked to be a seminar leader for undergraduate students and what that means is being really confident um at teaching at a very high level, my particular area of interest um organizing materials and making sure that people are coordinated. It's unlike classroom teaching where people turn up and just expect to learn something, there's a lot of free work that goes into that and that's why it's called seminar leadership rather than seminar teaching. I've also worked very hard to coordinate many conferences as well, which requires a lot of again pre work um and why that makes me a leader? Well it's because you have to be extremely organized to understand how people function and how they can be coordinated and that's not to say that leading is all about just telling a person what to do, it's about giving them the skills so that they can contribute to something by themselves. Um So being a co a coordinator for conference requires a lot of leadership because you're giving the direction, not only to the people that are maybe helping support you lead the conference, but also to the people that are submitting papers to that conference as well. So organization is a key characteristic of leadership as well. Another example I would say was um when I've been a leader as being a leader of a group of mentors. Now, mentoring again is another type of leadership in that you have a skill to offer to a person or a group of people. But mentoring mentors is an even um more complicated part of um being a leader or having a leading ability because you have to tell people also how to lead um which requires a lot of of brain work, but it also requires a lot of empathy as well. So I think empathy is being um is a really important leadership characteristic as well. Um Other places I have shown leadership um very specific, highly specific two examples like going abroad and working on on charity projects abroad. For example, I've been I've worked for a company called Link Ethiopia which links schools in England to schools in Ethiopia or schools in the kind of the west to schools in Ethiopia. And within that, um I had to make sure that everyone was safe because Ethiopia is a new culture and a new country. So I had to make sure people got there safely and also giving guidance to understanding how to negotiate a new environment when we got there and what responsibilities everyone had. So for example, delegating, who is going to be teaching english on this day and who is going to be creating crafts on this day, which seems like a very small part of leadership, but actually delegating and being able to again, coordinate is really, really important. So I hope I've demonstrated some leadership skills there. Thank you so much for listening.

Um so I think the most important thing about being a leader is to be calm collected and fair. Um at the end of the day you can sometimes sit in between middle or upper management and a team of people that you need to support and ensure that they thrive through the business while meeting the objectives of the higher management. Um I believe that being a common collective manager that is able to um yeah provide good support to staff below them while also meeting the achievements of the upper management is really important. Obviously the team are the people that do the job every single day and it's important to relate their messages, they're supporting their feedback to the upper management to sometimes promote change um and to bring about better work efficiency and I am a big believer in organization and I believe to succeed as a leader you need to be extremely organized, you need to know your staff inside out, you need to know the project inside out and you need to ensure that you have every bit of knowledge available to you to complete the task in hand. Um I went for a fiber broadband network um and our job is to install fiber to rural villages and then two obviously promote best customers. Um I sit in the operations management side and I want a small team of people in achieving these goals. I often find that ensuring that each member of the team fully understands their role through a brief, fully knows exactly what they need to do for that job is the best course of action. I find that me learning and knowing every aspect of their job. So I could do each person's job um if they were absent or they weren't able to complete a task, I could assist them with that, that that is the most important aspect of being a leader, you should know and be able to function in their rubble. So you understand completely the job that they need to do, you can empathize, you can completely understand what it is they're required to do in their role and you can support them where needed. You should not expect someone to complete the task. If you were not willing to do it yourself, I am a firm believer in being fair and understanding. Now, being understanding to me is knowing that person on an individual basis, not treating them as a number in an organization, but knowing their strengths, their weaknesses and what they need to succeed on where they're looking to go in the organization. Sometimes people are just happy to have a job, but others actually want to succeed. And I think it's important to know what each individual wants to achieve as a leader. I do think it's important to know your own strengths and weaknesses and always look to succeed. I'm a person that will always try to strive to be a better person day in day out, Whether that be that I sit and need some knowledge on a particular subject that we talked about that day, whether it is, I go away and do leadership training or I go and perhaps just read some news. So I'm up to date on day to day affairs so that if it comes to needing to have a chat with my team about something, I'm in the note and people trust in me and I believe trust is an important part of being a leader. You need to be able to deliver on your promises. Making false promises is not a good trait of a leader. And I believe knowing your goals and knowing what you can do to deliver that is important. I believe that you should be able to promise something and deliberate if you can't, I feel you'd be looked upon in a different light than the team from the team, sorry. And I believe that then they would lose a lack of respect and trust for you and not want to achieve your goals because at the end of the day, if you're covering a team, they are acting on your behalf. Optimism, Optimism and upper management. So it's important that they want to achieve for you. I believe it's important to have personal relationships not too personal. Obviously knowing them and considering them as people that are part of your team that you want to work with. I believe you need to be fair and understanding. Um, you need to be loyal to the team, but also on a professional basis and also loyal to those above you. You need to sit in the middle and you need to know exactly what each team are going to bring to you as a person.

Um My name is Cindy Lou and I would like to talk to you a little bit today about my journey of how my leadership style and skills have evolved. Um as you can see I'm not the youngest of persons. I think that when I was in my twenties after I graduated from college I thought that I would never really be a leader because I was an introvert and I had this misconception that leader strong leaders needed to be in your face, interacting with people all the time, speaking, showing people in charge putting out fires and really having a passion for interacting with other people and I was an introvert but that doesn't mean that I didn't like problem solving um and showing good leadership in an organization. What I found throughout my career by watching many of the leaders is that some of the best leaders were introverts because what they do is they listen, I'm gonna take off my glasses because it's reflective. They listen more than they talk and a leader who talks more than he listens is not the kind of leader that I want to be. Um A leader should listen and they should listen carefully and they should listen to all sides of things and they should make informed decisions based on data. Um I have a science background and I feel that an unemotional and firm leadership style based on data would be the right approach. Um I also understand from my experience that not all leadership positions will be exactly the same. You have to really get to know a company's culture. In fact my first leadership opportunity was overseas. I was a Peace corps volunteer and after my first year of teaching math in french in West Africa, I was promoted to department heads. Um and I really needed to work within the cultural constraints of the country I was working with for example, in their culture, you never ever admit mistakes. It's a sign of weakness and that's something that's not very intuitive to me, but I was able to adapt, still be myself but work within those cultural parameters. And while most corporations in the US don't have that extreme of a different culture, they do, we need to recognize that they do all have their own unique cultures and a good leader needs to understand the culture and work within those parameters. Um here in the US when I was department head, I found that admitting mistakes and owning them was really shown as a sign of strength and leaders who would not admit their mistakes were not as respected. Um finally I want to talk about being a leader of leaders. Um, one of the funnest things in my life right now is gonna show you my shirt is science olympiad. It's an organization and my group is all girls and we have a passion for stem women in stem and on saturday we just won the state competition and I'm so excited, it hasn't happened in years and years. And one of the things I attribute to our success is my group of student leaders that I've really given them an authentic leadership opportunity. Um, I don't micromanage how they do the groups. Um, the decisions they make, I am informed and we do have some discussions. They need to, to defend their choices, but I give them a lot of opportunities for failure. I think in our society, we really don't let kids take real risks anymore. We set them up so that they're guaranteed to succeed and I really feel like giving them an opportunity to take a risk and have an authentic leadership experience. And that worked out really well for us on saturday. So anyway, we are running out of time.

My name's Debbie Willits and I'm applying for the manager's position. I think I'd be a good fit for the vacancy because I've been in running running a family business since 1989. That's over 30 years of looking at a small to medium sized business grow From a relatively small turnover with a couple of staff to Â£3m turnover. Now With over 30 staff along the way, I've also benefited from receiving coaching and mentoring from the growth accelerator. This means I had access to professionals who are able to guide us into our business growth on the back of that um, investment in us, I was able to consider my next development, my own personal development. So this involves things like setting up regular management meetings, regular single page plans and orbit so that we could really plot and plan the company's growth and everybody who was involved in key decisions. Was I able to follow our trajectory? This led to further training and the most aligned training that we found suitable was with the chartered managers, managers, institute C. M. I. So I began a course of training that led me to successfully completing the C. M. I. Chartered Management Institute training where I passed an endpoint assessment, mm hmm. Furthermore, I furthermore, after that training was complete and the Endpoint Endpoint Assessment was successful. The project was particularly praised for the money saving ideas that I put forward. I decided to further my human resources management skills. This led to a post graduate degree at a local university in coaching and mentoring and which really helped me with my ability to help our staff. And what was interesting about this training is we're able to find um well being training in the local area which involved which involved thrive at work well being program where I was able to secure funds for the company and really help us to provide a good provision for our staff. I'm talking about things like um access to healthcare and where they could find it locally. Um local walks where they could take those important breaks from work and the whole ethos of being a good manager. I felt on the back of that training was our ability to really put the employers first and find out how we could help them um to be able them to perform well in their roles. And we took a holistic approach and we looked at everything from health to desk to their environment. Did they have the tools and equipment that they needed? And I think this journey that I've been on has really put me in a good place to be a better manager, not just in manufacturing and construction, but across all industries because they all have the same dynamic and there's an end goal, company goal, but there's also um employees are at the heart of the business and I have found in my Career over 30 years, but if you really consider the needs of your employees then you can really help your business, you'll retain staff, staff will be happy in their work. Um We'll be interested in doing a good job for you but most importantly it will become a great experience for the customer, the end users of your products or services. They will get to know your staff. Um and it will be a whole 360 approach to work well being in sales. So I really hope that you've enjoyed my presentation and that you would consider me for your job as manager. I'll be happy to answer any questions that you've got, um references, skills training that I've completed and I'll be happy to discuss any further questions that you might have.

This is because you know the establishment, you can see it at its best and at its work, you're not coming in possibly with idealistic views, uh but you've actually been and seen and worked with people and are therefore able to understand the situation a little bit more personally. I am a very organized person. I'm good at time managing. I can see what needs to be done and organize my time accordingly. It's also important to be aware and to be able to listen to what the staff say and I feel that another quality of mine is that I am a good listener, that is really important to start well being and to help them to understand what perhaps some decisions are being made perhaps, which aren't necessarily what they would agree with good communication and being able to speak, help them understand the importance of the reasoning behind those decisions counter a lot to get people on your side rather than being seen to for those and just have perhaps an agenda where perhaps they don't understand the ethos behind some of the decisions that are being made. So, just to recap what I've said so far, first of all, I feel that because I've been in the workplace for quite a long time that can actually be a positive, although sometimes I know people consider somebody coming in uh can be good, but actually a wealth of experience within an establishment can be good. Another thing that I think is being able to listen to people to hear their views, help make decisions, but also have communication with them too, help them to understand why decisions are being made. Another thing is organization, I really feel that being organized, being able to meet deadlines, allocate tasks and kind of getting the job done is a really good management skills. I felt from experience perhaps lower down the levels leading by experience is really important and getting things done and not moving deadlines and making sure everybody knows exactly what is expected of them is a very, very positive thing leading by example, because I think otherwise, if you don't need by example, a lot of things are empty words and I don't feel that you've then got the staff behind you, so I feel that that is a really good quality of my organization, getting the job done, meeting deadlines and just, just understanding what the company needs to do with progress and move forward. Another thing as a manager I would really be keen to do is get involved within the community because I really feel that a big organization within a community needs to work with that community, so perhaps organizing some events which involve the whole community and then they're on your side as well. That can only be a good thing. So lots of reasons why I feel that I have management material experience, communication, organization, listening, The qualities which I feel like this the company needs in this management role is important. Um, other things are, the ways of garnering feedback would be, uh, possibly getting some questionnaires, finding out what is what is important to the people that work there, being firm, but fair being human, um, perhaps having, um, you know, the rules, but listening shoot them.

Um The manager's position that I'm applying for today is within the education sector. Um So firstly I would just like to explain that currently have 10 years worth of experience within the education sector, particularly within data reporting and government funding. At the moment I manage a team of support staff based across a number of different sites or to multidisciplinary team across a widely positioned an organization. So in terms of my leadership skills, um first and foremost I am very confident and knowledgeable in my particular area, having worked in it for a number of years, so I find it very natural for me to take leadership of a team given that I'm able to answer most questions most queries um and sort of look at any concerns that may arise within that that area. Yeah. Um I also possess um a lot of people's skills having worked with people from multiple backgrounds, multiple abilities and level of experience over the years have quite strong communication skills to spend a lot of time meeting with people from various areas of the organization working at the moment and varying levels of the staffing structure. So anywhere from um students, parents teaching staff all the way up to the senior leadership team, the principal ship and the executives of the organization. So communication is a strong point of mine. Um I also am very much a people person, so I enjoy bringing groups of people together to work on specific tasks or projects um and I find it quite easy to get to know all of those staff members and also use skills in motivation to help with my leadership of that team or the execution of a certain projects or making sure that everybody understands what it is, that their rule is how they are to carry that rule out how they interconnect with the rules of other people on the team and how they contribute to the final outcome of a task or project. I also have quite a lot of empathy for staff, so I understand that all members of staff, all members of the team are people, they are humans. Um Some may struggle more with other than others with certain aspects of work. They may not be confident enough to speak up if they don't understand, they may have external factors happening outside of the workplace which may affect their performance and as a manager, as a leader, it is my job to understand those sort of mitigating factors um to understand the people that I work with, to have empathy with them and also to be supportive in any way that I can. Um so it's about understanding that everybody that I work with is different and come from different backgrounds and it's about motivating those staff members to learn something new, pick up a new skill, contribute to a wider project that involves a lot of people. Also in my role as manager, I have to be highly organized. I have a very logical approach to problem solving thinking outside of the box and also bringing people together from multiple teams and multiple backgrounds to be able to um solve the problem or highlight a concern or come up with a resolution um or coming up with new ways of working that would make things a lot more efficient. I have project management um skills also through qualifications I've completed, which enabled me to sort of see, see the team, see the work Claude and see how I can use those project management skills to concentrate on particular areas to make sure that we are working as efficiently as we can as a team. I'm clear and concise in my directions and yet I'm just able to bring everyone together to complete and achieve whatever task we are set out to do.

My name is Amy and this is my video explaining why I think I should be considered for a managerial position within my company. The company I work for is the University of Sussex and the role that I would like to be considered for is for an undergraduate admissions manager. I believe that I should be considered for this role as I've been working for the undergraduate admissions department now for the past four years. So I've been working as an undergraduate admissions coordinator since 2018 when I started out in the role, I spent a lot of time shadowing colleagues and during that time I really learned the kind of skills and attributes that I just I believe makes a good leader. Um somebody that's empathetic, that's warm and open and I think those qualities really make somebody approachable that you feel don't feel like any question is a silly question and you feel quite comfortable going to them with any suggestions or things that maybe you're perhaps a little bit concerned about. There are a few questions about things that have already been shown, for example how to process something properly on the computer and I think had it been a different kind of environment, maybe I would have felt a little bit silly. Um but instead I actually felt like they weren't going to laugh at me. Um It just felt like a really inclusive environment. So I definitely endeavor to replicate that within my own practice as I've gained lots of experience throughout the company over the last few years. One of the things I've learned to deal with is time management. Um There are certain times of the year when admissions can be really busy, For example, during the summer period, when people are getting exam results, it can be quite difficult to prioritize all of the different tasks. Um so I'm very efficient in terms of managing my workflow every morning, making lists, prioritizing what needs to be done now, what can be done later, what can be done in the future? Um I'm also very experienced dealing with potentially tricky or volatile situations. Um Working in admissions, it's a really highly charged emotional environment. Um Often students can get quite upset or parents can get quite upset or perhaps quite persuasive on the phone and it's being able to manage those emotions and have a positive but constructive conversation. And I think it's important as well that perhaps management boys, you might be the person where a colleague is having a conversation and the person has become quite aggressive or I don't know how to deal with that situation. I think I'd be an excellent person to turn to because not only have I experienced lots of difficult scenarios, but I also think it's really important that even if we cannot offer that student a place at our institution that we provide them with appropriate next steps or signpost for support because I believe that we really do have a duty of care to that person's well being. Um and I think that if we establish ourselves as an institution that want the best for every young person regardless of whether that's with us or somewhere else, then that will in turn means that people are a lot more proactive in contacting us a lot more com in conversations and that hopefully will reduce the scenario of aggressive or negative experiences that my colleagues have to face. I think in terms of management as well, one of the things that's really important is recruitment, ensuring that we recruit a diverse range of people that have a lived experiences, perhaps of going through the process of applying to university for various types of degrees or already have experience working in admissions departments and other institutions. That's a real variety of different skills that they might have and I've assisted with lots of different recruitment scenarios. So I'm very used to thinking about the kinds of questions that you might ask a potential applicant um and also being able to deliver constructive criticism. I think that's another really important thing um because it's not easy sometimes when you have to potentially tell somebody they haven't been successful. So it's phrasing that in a positive way and I really, really happy to discuss any of these scenarios in more detail um perhaps in the future interview. Um So I want to thank you for taking the time to listen to my application. I hope that judging by the amount of experience. So I had working within the company um, and the strong relationships that I've had with colleagues, past and present that you can see that I believe I would be a very strong candidate for this role. I look forward to hearing from you seen many thanks for your time.",NEUTRAL,0.188,0.0098,0.8022,0.0001,817.0,MED,10,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),13.79,1,0,0,"Master's degree (e.g. MA, MS, MEd)",Female,9.049466,9.366033,9.14611

I have a great interpersonal communication skills which means I use my tone of voice, my body language etcetera. Um, two communicate with others. This shows somebody that I am actively listening to what they're telling me, which means that I am clearly taken on the information that they provided me with. Um I enjoy enjoy goal setting. Um, so I like to set goals for myself and if I was to gain this managing position, um obviously goals for my team and for the team members, um, diplomacy is very important also as well as motivation. Um so I believe the manager has to have, it has to be rather um motivated, unable to motivate others. Um so they'll be able to keep team morale up and ensure that all the team members are motivated in completing the job that they native complete I suppose. Um I believe conflict resolution is also a leadership skill that I have. Um so I am able to, as I've already stated, communicate effectively and actively listen to others. Um so therefore within conflict resolution, I would be able to sit between two team members who um were in conflict at the time. I would be able to listen to both for more parties. Um finding out what the issue is and how, how we can resolve that issue. Um working together with the team to make sure that this doesn't impact on the rest of the team. I also believe I'm very good, I'm quite decisive, which is good for decision making, so I'm able to make decisions quickly and effectively, so I would make sure that I am consider everything in front of me. So for example if I was considering a new team member, I would be able to um consider their experiences and skills as well as how they personality traits I suppose come across and how they seem on a face to face basis. I believe those um provide good leadership skills as well as well as being empathetic, being able to problem solve. So like I said making decisions um being creative, having integrity, being able to get delegate is also very important um as well as being flexible. Um confidence is another thing that a leader a leader will need. Um So I believe I'm confident and I would be able to um run a team of people. A leader also has to be accountable for the decisions they make and the actions that they complete have to have critical thinking and also time management. So they would need to be able to complete tasks on time um and be honest, kind and cave in. And that's the end of my interview.

Today I'm going to be talking a little bit more about my background and my experience on why I'd like to be the manager of this institution and before we get started I do thank you for your time today and I really look forward to speaking, asking questions, answering questions and really just getting to know you guys more. Um So really today I'm gonna be going over my leadership skills which on that topic I think my top three skills are one organization as a leader, to my empathy as a leader and three my ability to empower and develop employees. Um to be where they are currently at two you know really follow down the corporate ladder and to continue to grow and my ability to assist them in that helping find out what their what their goals are and what they want to do on the topic of organization. I think in this specific position I'm in currently organization is key. Um You know a lot of my daily job includes my my daily activities really include um counting inventory, material supplies and really having a quick eye to make sure that you know nothing is uncounted and I'm able to do it in an efficient manner so that I can continue doing other jobs throughout the day. In my position. You know when I first started there was no um really like a checklist or any sort of table I can check off items on. So I developed one. So um you know that really helped take away time that I could be, I could spend doing something else, but instead I'm stuck, you know counting inventory more and more. It also helps when I am out of work and I need to have someone else cover this for me. So I can just give my checklist that I created that really goes over the locations of where everything is and goes over all the materials that need to be covered, checked and have a tally count at the end. Um and it ties in, it goes right into an Excel spreadsheet that I have on my computer so that it can be easily accessible. Um and that cut about I would say 30 minutes of my count time so I can now spend those 30 minutes doing something else. Another skill I think that I really do possess and I want to talk about today will be my empathy as a manager. I think it's very important to be able to put yourself in other shoes when it comes to caring for your employees. And I think the way that you talk to employees and the way that you interact with them really can have a make or break on their day. I know this, I am sure you all know this as well as someone who's had a manager at some point in their life. Um you know my first job, I had a really terrible manager honestly, she didn't communicate well, she didn't really put herself in our shoes at all. And so when it came to things like taking days off sick leave, she was very difficult to, and it ultimately made me leave my job. I feel that's more costly then, you know, keeping employees so why not just do what you can to make employees stay? Um I do have a, um I do conduct weekly one on ones with members of the team, so I can really just check in and see how they're doing, gauge how they're feeling because that's the most important thing for me. Um and by and by doing that, you know, I'm able to have more employee retention in which my employee retention has increased this year from 15% now up to 25%, which in the service industry is very hard to do. As for my last skill I possess, I believe it's really my ability to empower and develop other employees. So with that being said, one thing I do also conducted my traditional one on ones is, you know, a blank space on their chart they can fill out, which really says like, what do you want to talk about? What, what do you want to do? What questions do you have? I do have a new hire employee packet. I have distributed out to new employees, so right off that I can find out, you know what their skills are, what are their goals are, what skills do they want to develop and how I can best help them again, like I said with coming in with empathy, I really do have an ability to, you know, um you know interact well with people and you know really be able to understand what their goals are employed. Your attention is everything in the service and kind of tying in with my last, my first school I mentioned organization, you know, all of those things, I have my, my spreadsheets, my packets, I do organize them really well in my office so that if I'm out someone has access to them, you know, with with proper security in place of course, um so that they're able to find them access them easily. Same thing with myself. Um so that really is in all in all my leadership skills and why do you think I best um should be in the position as the next upcoming manager.

Um I feel like I am an inattentive and I'm an open leader, I feel that communication is very important and I try to encourage performance by nurturing and mentoring my team members. Um I'm very open and I'm very enthusiastic as you can see, I strive to be a leader who nurtures others to their fullest potential. This is a trait that I've carried since childhood as a youth, I would spend my time teaching the neighborhood kids as english tutor, helping them improve their reading skills. Um As a young adult, I volunteered for the food bank as well as the men's mission that we have downtown. I consider myself a positive example for others and I'm helping them guide them through, but our career moves and further successes and I'm also my teammates biggest cheerleader. When it comes to their successes, I'm number one and always supporting them. Um they're not afraid to approach me with their mistakes, knowing that I can collaborate with them um to figure out what the problem is and hopefully we can learn together. Um I enjoy problems solving as a child. I love puzzles and challenges. So whenever we encountered a difficult situation at work, I'm usually the number one person to go to and I'm very excited to learn some new ideas and and come across some new situations and to improve those. Um I am enjoying being positive and I am efficient and I'm accountable. Um What I've noticed is that people will naturally follow my lead even when I'm not necessarily in charge and I definitely take great responsibility in that um and I thrive on taking the lead on projects and just even everyday tasks, I'm always the first person in the door um and I'm always um you know, ready to go right at my start time um attribute all of these skills, all these leadership skills to my good communication, just my problem solving skills. Um If I had to categorize it, I would say that my leadership skills are probably my leadership leadership style is probably highly democratic, I'm always trying to empower the people that I work with and make them participate in decisions that we make in the department, I'm not very, I'm not very strict in that sense, but I do believe that in a working environment people learn from other people um and are entirely our entire department will actually grow um under this type of leadership um in my organization. Um considering its size with so many employees that we have working um empowering people and letting them make the decisions on their own. Um As time allows it of course is the only way that we can meet deadlines. Um So this progresses, you know faster than other organizations I think um It's my role as a leader though to make sure that all of our employees, our understanding our values um and the direction that we want to go with the company and make those decisions accordingly. I also tried to lead by example. Um so I would never ask someone to stay longer at work if I, you know, was to leave at 5:00. Um I in my approach, you know, this can yield good results, so and I and I do definitely use this in my everyday, so unless I'm prepared to stay as well, I don't ask my my employees to stay longer. Um You're probably looking for someone who is accountable, you're probably looking for someone that has active listening skills and creative. Um I definitely describe myself as a critical thinker. Um I definitely am decisive and I can delegate accordingly as well. Um I think my leadership style takes the advantage of those strengths um and I definitely delegate tasks to whoever is best equipped for the job um to perform a task. Um and I definitely communicate clearly about the position about what I expect to be done and why it needs to be done as well, and this eliminates a lot of the back and forth, a lot of the mistakes, a lot of having to redo it. My motto is touch it once. Um everybody knows that at work. Um It's just taking the time, you know, to communicate that effectively, which is important. I think you're probably looking for someone who is highly intelligent, um has a lot of emotional intelligence as well. A lot of empathy, empathy goes a long way in this day and age. I think you're probably looking for someone who has integrity, um, who's also motivated, um, positive and patient, um, which I believe I definitely have those qualities and um, yeah, so I'm very happy that you watch this video and thank you so much for considering me for the position.",POSITIVE,0.9295,0.0011,0.0666,0.0028,819.0,LOW,6,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),17.18,1,0,0,"Bachelor's degree (e.g. BA, BS)",Female,8.959115,9.27644,9.407782

So I have quite a ride ranging um types of leadership skills that come from the many different types of projects that I've been involved in. So primarily I've been involved in large and small scale programs that are involved with working with different types of people. So one set of work that I have undertaken is working on large mentoring programs, matching young people to undergraduate mentors and linking them in different schools with um young people who have a need to understand how to progress in higher education and it's not in their family background. These large scale programs take place over a number of other usually take place over a year, so the mentor needs to go into school and a number of occasions to speak to the young people ending with an event at the university in this kind of event. Um and this kind of program, there's a huge amount of aspects to consider from training and managing 50 student mentors to arranging for them to be paid to actually deploying them into schools to choosing appropriate schools for them to work with. And also ensuring that each young person has information that they need and require. This involves a huge amount of leadership leadership skills, not only in the staff that I coordinate within the different aspects of the program, but also with the individual mentors ensuring that they feel they know what they're doing, that they're supported, that they have appropriate checks to work with young people and that they have the skills necessary to deliver the work that needs to be done. Also that they have, they kind of warmth and ability to work with people which is undertaken with quite a strict recruitment program. So all of these aspects are aspects that I and personally and thoroughly involved him and I decide from beginning to end how this program runs everything that happens within it, and that's all through my strong leadership skills. Also, within these kind of programs, I work with external partners, um, primarily those in education. So with educational charities, some of big national ones to individual schools and school teachers who act as gatekeepers for their young people, I've got a project management qualification and this has allowed me to further develop my skills and to ensure that I use them in the most appropriate way in my own role. And this is something that I can bring into a new, well, really convincingly because it's something that I've done quite recently, I was able to sift out from that information, the things that will be specifically useful too. My role and I will be able to do that in my new role as well. So that's a great skill set that I will bring with me too. Um, I also work currently with academics, which you are an incredibly interesting group of people to work with. Um they are not too dissimilar from working with younger people and they're they're often challenging to work with and they always think that they're right as younger people do, but there is many skills and ways of working with different types of people. I have a knowledge that I have that helps me, I manage my own time and um I'm effective at working with groups or I'm managing groups to, but also being part of a group, I would never ask somebody to do something that I wouldn't be willing to do myself. And I think that's a really important skill as a leader is to Equally be the person that is willing to pick up a piece of rubbish off the floor as well as somebody else to do it, as standing in front of a group of 600 people as I've done on many occasions to speak about important topics and things that might be relevant. I really am the kind of person that leads by doing what needs to be done, and also leading by example, without demanding things from people, but rather talking to people explaining the processes, talking about the individual parts, making sure people understand their part within that bigger process and making sure that they feel that they have a relevant element to that as well. And that there it's important for them to for their part to work in order for everybody else's part to work as well. So, I make people see the benefit in the value of themselves within that too.

Okay. Um I'm discussing my my qualities and my past experience in respect to teaching. Um as I am a fully qualified teacher of science at secondary level And have been for the last 21 years since qualifying. Um So I have quite a lot of experience in that area. Um my special is um as I said, is is science. And more specifically, I've taught all three sciences to age 16. Um I have also taught A level Biology, A. Level, psychology and some maths and physics, Physics at A. Level and GCSE and key stage three. Um And some mass up to key stage three. My actual real special is um in the sciences is Biology. Um And I've been the biology lead in various schools. I've worked across seven schools since I've become fully qualified. So I've gained a really wide range of experience of different sorts of schools, Different setups from academies to smaller schools, the smallest school I've worked out being 400 students And the largest one has been 1700. I've worked in inner city areas such as uh Peterborough in the outskirts of London. I've also worked in more rural areas. So I have a really broad breadth and experience of the different sorts of schools, students, demographics teaching way that things are taught in schools and they're sort of teaching styles and the abilities of students. Because two of the schools of torts that were high ability um State grammar schools And the others have been either mixed ability or for Children that failed the 11 plus in one area where that still exists, As I said, 21 years experience, 19 of those years I've spent in management type roles. So I've been the key stage three science coordinator for three years. Um Four years, sorry, I've also been head of A level Biology for four or five years, I was the head of Psychology in one school, so it was three years worth. I've done playing classroom teacher work for two years obviously, and as as all my other roles in management, I still maintain full classroom teaching as well and I've been the head of department for the rest of that time, so quite a number of years now um as such, I have a great amount of experience of all the different sorts of roles are encompassed in teaching. So not only the classroom side of things, but managing of the staff, managing the department, ensuring cohesion between all the members of the department, managing different levels of staff and and of course dealing with Children um students and all the problems that come with that, including the discipline and behavior management. So I feel with one of my strong points is I think true of most teachers that we have normally got really good teamwork and the successful department has that excellent sort of teamwork side of working, I've worked hard to develop an exemplary department with excellent off stead results on all inspections and in fact it's been exemplary to the point where they've they've put our department forward for the rest of the schools to show best working practice from. We already do that anyway, we work really well with the other departments as a team, Myself and my staff are immensely proud of them and how we work together and how they're nervous departments look to us for ideas and for inspiration on how they can achieve the same that we get. We've got a really stressful working environment because we we support each other fully. We have an area where we all meet at all points. So the staff a very good um professional friendships if you like with great amounts of respect for one another and I believe staff in my department are very happy. We work hard to ensure that we have an up to date working syllabus and curriculum. We very much work on that as a team and we all delegate towards one another.

I teach Children from age 11 all the way up to 18, I stand in front of various age Children several times a day are varying different class sites is in various different needs. I have to install into these Children, a passion for learning, I have to communicate effectively. I have to make my lessons fun entertaining, engaging, so that they want to come back and that they want to learn more and they want to learn again and at the same time as well as being their teacher, I have to be their mentor, I have to be their guidance. I have to follow whole school rules, I have to follow behavior policies and safeguarding policies. I have two rules and regulations that I need to install in the classroom to ensure that my behavior management is fair and that students are all being treated the same. I have to treat them the same and yet they're not the same, their needs are changing. Some of them can write more than others, some of them right at different speeds, some of them are learning difficulties and some of them have so much going on at home that actually there focus isn't on learning at all. I need to be their friend, someone that they can talk to someone that they can approach. I need to master the art of delivering high quality content planning lessons, marking books, giving assessments and deal with all of these things at the same time as making sure their education and their learning progresses and a lot of the time I have to be a good negotiator, I have to show compassion and empathy and some of them come into the classroom in a highly heightened state. They've just had break time and I need to bring their level right down and their focus back to learning. I need to guide them and I need to offer advice and you might ask, well, okay that might make you a good leader, but how does that make you a good manager? Well part of managing people is leading but at the same time actually I also lead a team of staff. I am the head of department and these in this context, adults are coming to me for advice and guidance. I have to be professional and be a friend to them. And yet I also need to deliver constructive criticism when things need to get better. I need to give Diploma, be diplomatic, I need to be professional, I need to give guidance, I need to give direction. I sometimes need to give a telling off to both students and staff but I need to do it in a way that does not cause us offense because I need to be a team player and I need these people to be on my side and as part of my role as their line manager, I need to help them progress and help them develop as people as teachers. I need to share their knowledge because without them as a team I would be nothing. I need them to be on my side. I need to communicate effectively what I want for all of us to accomplish as a team and ensure that we're all doing the same thing that it's fair for the students that it's clear, I need to communicate that clearly so that they can develop that communication and that consistency within their classrooms. I need to give them clear direction and guidance and advice on where to go. I need to set cover work and be supportive if they've got family events going on and they cannot make it into work. I need to support their well being as well as their professional development. I need to support their health and make sure they are strong but also competent in the classroom. I think that means I'm used to being calm under pressure. I'm used to be approachable, I'm talking to people and I believe that all of these things having encompassing a person as a whole will not only make me a good leader but also make sure I'm a good manager, but I'm used, I'm someone that's approachable that will listen, but also will take the hard line when it needs to be taken",POSITIVE,0.8637,0.003,0.1313,0.002,761.0,HIGH,11,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),25.73,1,0,0,"Bachelor's degree (e.g. BA, BS)",Female,9.528159,9.847059,10.1397

I am from Melbourne Australia and I'm applying for a manager's position at this workplace because I believe I'm the best candidate for the rock. I work at a big department retail store um which has a lot of different sections including printing technology and stationary. I have a lot of knowledge in all three of those areas. As I've been working at this store for four years, I've been trained in tech um stationary as well as print and copy. So printing out anything for customers such as large format jobs, laminating binding posters, all that type of stuff. Um So I originally worked as a team member for four years just working my way up through casual and then part time I then decided I want to take the next step because I was working very hard and I wanted to learn more about the business and learn more about manager manager skills. I studied business in uni and I decided studying wasn't really for me, I was much more of a hands on learner. So I wanted to do a manager role instead where I could learn more hands on. I got that position. I started as a key holder which basically just started off as opening the store by myself, just managing the team and just doing little jobs that were a bit higher up than what a casual part time team member would do. So such as finances um and returns online, returns stuff like that. My main position was basically just running the team when the hire managers couldn't do so, so I do that on the weekends. Um And then recently I decided to take an even further step by becoming a coordinator, so this is a full time role on salary, so that enabled me to get my first aid um as well as my forklift lessons. Um I then started working 40 hours a week just by working about eight hours a day. My main skills are okay running a team, so um just sectioning people out into the workplace as to what jobs they need to do such as stock, um print and copy um point of sale. So I just had to run that and make sure the night went smoothly. Um I was working nights, I just had to make sure that all of the stock was done. I have a lot to do with the stock coming in and coming out so I need to do a lot of paperwork in terms of filing all of that um and all that type of stuff. It's been very challenging during covid as we've had quite a lot of closures and had to adapt quite quickly to all the different closures, so for example, we had to close the store and do click and collect only in that sense we needed to make sure that everything was clean, we have to change the way that our store worked so I was a part of that um we had to sort out um click and collect, so customers would have to line up at the door that went quite smoothly. And that is also something that shaped me to what I am now in terms of change. I found it hard to adapt with change and that was a really good way to sort of adapt to that also. Um times that I had, that was challenging. Is probably interactions with some customers. I have been abused quite a lot, especially during the covid situation, physically and verbally. So that was definitely a tough time in terms of being a manager. But as a manager you kind of have to take things how it comes and not take things personally because it's not personal towards you. It's just how people are acting and feeling. So I had a customer whacked me in the face with her walking stick. That wasn't good. We had to call the police because she's physically abused someone and that was how we dealt with that situation because we don't tolerate any physical abuse. Um But majority of situations that customers have, I tend to be able to just smooth them over and the customer is always right, so we always have to help out the customer with anything I'm good at um sort of coming up with different alternatives. So say something, customers asking a question about something and said we don't have it in stock. I can help them with different alternatives. Um that has worked really well, so I've learned quite a lot of things whilst being a manager.

Um I guess in terms of my leadership, I am quite young um but despite this I'm very passionate about leadership and I definitely hope to improve my leadership skills um even though I'm also very introverted, um I have come out of my shell a bit and I really tried to progress my leadership skills, so I do quite a lot of leadership things in my current day to day life, but I would really like to take those to the next level um and to further my leadership abilities and actually work in this full time. So I guess for me my leadership passion came very strongly once I finished my undergraduate degree. Um I just sort of skirted my way through that and was really just focused on my grades and I did get really good grades and I finished it, but I was very much lacking the experience and extracurriculars. And so now that I'm doing a PhD, I'm trying to encompass all of that and get more leadership goals ticked off and develop my leadership skills. So I guess my PhD is a good place to start. So I'm working on a very large clinical trial at the moment with health and I play a huge role in facilitating meetings including co development meetings with staff of our services. And I also have been involved with um supervising volunteers who have helped us on our project as well um and playing a role in supporting staff members, so that's been a really helpful start. Um But I'm also currently undertaking of course um whilst doing my PhD called island, which has run through my university and in this we really get to learn hands on skills about leadership. Um We get mentoring as well from really prominent leaders in our field and it's been really nice to get to actually implement these skills and see how they work in reality and also help with projects. I recently ran a focus group as a part of island, which was great. I um put all the questions and activities together and planned the whole event and then facilitated it, which was fantastic. I'm also a peer mentor. So I think now that I've got a degree and I'm a bit more comfortable in myself and what I'm capable of, I want to help other students going through what I did and help push them to be more active in their studies. So that's another thing that I'm also doing. I've also just started supervising honest students, so that's definitely new territory. Um So I'll be supervising to honor students this year for the whole year through their research endeavors, which is very exciting and um yeah, helping them with all aspects, so keeping them on task and making sure that they're on track, getting them to meetings, reviewing their work, making sure that they're on task and helping them with their leadership skills. So we've been working on their presentation skills as well and their writing skills, which is really good. I think definitely one of the big things for me with my leadership that I've um come to love is teaching and I think that's where my love for leadership and passion came from. So I started teaching last year when I started my PhD and I've been teaching ever since and I've just gotten a position as an associate lecturer in medicine, which is very exciting um for this semester, so I very much love being up in front of the class even though I'm a huge introvert. Um it's now saying I'm really passionate about and even things like marking and being able to give back what I've been given before in my degree is really nice, so that's sort of my main areas of leadership and I've also recently undergone the fantastic opportunity of being on the student representative council of my university in which I'm the postgraduate representative, so representing all post graduates, which is really exciting and I'm very passionate about postgraduate study and I think it's fantastic that people keep wanting to learn and study and so I am very much grateful for this position to um and to also be a director of that company as a student as well.

Um this was no fault of my teams. This came from above us in order to motivate my team to enable us to achieve this target, I was able to negotiate a performance bonus for my team. This meant that they were happier to put in a little bit more effort in order for everybody to achieve the goals that was required of them.

Excuse me. Um, I've worked as a manager in education for over 10 years now, both in the private sector and in the public sector. I've managed smaller teams, larger teams with many conflicting demands. So let me tell you a little bit about my expertise and what I could potentially bring to the role. So in my current role I manage a small team and I manage centers delivering exams, we deliver a government contract. And from inception we've grown the business um, exponentially each year. And that's despite additional competition. We've successfully bid for tenders and had repeat success with that, which I think is testament to how well we work with that government interferes as well as the level of service we provide to our service users. So for example, when we originally got the contract, we had one of the competition and we had about 85% of market share Throughout that initial five year period with that contract, not only did we maintain that market share with the competition, we actually exceeded it. So we grew the business and at one point we actually had 96 market shark. Now one of the main reasons for that is that we never take customers for granted. We have a high market share and it would be easy to sit back and think great, we're doing good, we're bringing in a good amount of revenue, but that isn't, um, the option for success. We need to continually push against complacency, maintaining that market position, looking at what we can do to help our customers and from that, what we've done is we've actually opened additional centers throughout the country. So we've gone from having in my regional area, one center to actually three. So we're really bringing our service into communities where the community needs us and that has been crucial to our success for the last tender. We've actually increased the competition there now. three of the competitors We anticipated in my region that I would seem perhaps a 20% reduction due to the increased competition. Whereas actually we've seen um, an increase and that has been down to me pushing to get into communities. We opened a center in an area where we knew that they would be um, high demand is something that I pushed for from the moment we got the new contract, I went to the management team with details about why this would be beneficial to the business, how it would keep us ahead of our competitors And rather than have a 20% reduction in canton shooter. What we've actually seen is that we actually had a 3% increase, which is absolutely phenomenal. We've also, or should I say I've worked really hard to develop ah relationships within the community. A lot of our customers come to us through word of mouth recommendations. So it's really important that they know that we are a trusted brand that they can come to us. They will be trapped with respect. They will have a really positive experience. And that word of mouth recommendation accounts for a significant part of our business and the growth that we've seen over the last seven years. I bring to this role also the experience from working in higher education. So I understand the other aspect of um management with conflicting deadlines. I used to manage um admissions to higher education courses, exam confirmations that had a lot of conflict in deadlines and you were constantly managing like numbers in terms of you don't want to.",POSITIVE,0.6741,0.0007,0.3248,0.0004,624.0,MED,8,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),10.61,1,0,0,"Master's degree (e.g. MA, MS, MEd)",Female,8.691902,9.015706,8.779455

So I like to hire grads um and focus on the development of soft skills. Um I don't like us and them mentalities and I like having quite an egalitarian team. So I focus on the pastel rock stuff and giving that level of care and skills development to my team rather than trying to establish power dynamics or hierarchies or anything like that.

Then working in innovation consultancy fees, so I've led a number of global research projects with clients in the transport and luxury sectors. Um And as I said before, originally this was in terms of people management mainly about freelancers. We were quite a small agency, so I would develop a a tight project timeline set all those key milestones in place and I just make sure I had access to the right people the right extra researchers, we're right designers, pairs of hands at any time in the project. Um And in more recent time I've had the luxury of putting together a small team that specialize in my particular field of consultancy. Okay.

So in the past I have managed a couple of teams in different capacities. I haven't managed anyone here in the current in the current business but um I'm looking to broaden my horizons as it were. So in the past I was a bakery manager, which I started at the bakery as a baker and then I went up to supervisor and then manager um because I have a really good balance of the creativity with the, you know the number crunching the rational side of it, I can balance them very well and I have a very analytical mind in that sense. Um So not only was it baking, creating recipes, things like that, it was doing orders, it was looking after a team of bakers and making sure everything was running smoothly from morning until night. Um Yeah, and making sure that the cafe was making a profit, making sure we were up to speed and health and safety, things like that. So and then before that I was a stand in manager for a previous finance role. So that meant when the manager was away, I would stand in and Basically look after a team of about 20 people, make sure everyone was just staying on track, delegate work, things like that. Um and yeah, just make sure everything was running smoothly. Our team, our targets were very, very high. So it was, it was a lot about listening to my teammates who were the same level as me, but then I was above them a bit and just kind of understanding where they came from and yeah, being the best manager I could be attending morning meetings. Um, things like that. So my core aims as a manager is well, firstly my organizational skills are second to none. I, everything in my life is super organized and I think I'm ready to branch out and organize other people, not micromanage but just make sure everything is on track to what I would be doing um and make sure everything is running smoothly. Um mm hmm. Another cool aim. Asman, jah is mistakes are okay. I feel like it's very important to consider um my team's mental health whilst doing the job because it is a very difficult job and I think that the idea that they were not allowed to make mistakes is a terrible idea because they are going to get very anxious about not making mistakes and I feel like every mistake is a learning curve, it's when these same mistakes are repeated, that is when you know something's wrong. So I want to create a very stable environment for my team to work in and have weekly check in see how they're doing because we are all working from home and it can be a bit lonely as well. So I think them if their mental health and mentality is good, they feel like I will check in with them all the time and they feel that there were a valued member of the team and I think that will reflect in their work thanks.",NEUTRAL,0.4504,0.0055,0.5417,0.0024,615.0,MED,7,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),12.5,1,0,0,"Bachelor's degree (e.g. BA, BS)",Female,8.764804,9.085878,8.880406

I am in a really unique position um and have a really unique background that brings a lot to a role like this. So I got my undergraduate degree in journalism. Uh So I had to learn a lot about a myriad of different subjects um and really had to quickly become an expert in those subjects, not only um you know, learning about them, but then communicating some of those harder to grasp concepts in a really easy to digest more layman's terms kind of way. Um So I have a lot of practice in learning about something, formulating it in my head um and either verbally or um you know, through written word then bundling that up into a nice little easy to understand package. I then after that worked in the intersection of communication and tech, so I did a lot of editorial and marketing work for startups. And then now in the current day I'm currently getting my Master's in computing and information systems just to kind of backtrack and fill a lot of those technical gaps that I had noticed I could improve on. So now I'm proficient in several languages and I'd say I'm the strongest in python, but I also know c++ sequel java. Html and CSS. Um So with all of that knowledge, this would also be my first managerial role, but in university I was a digital director to an on campus zine called Jerk magazine, where I completely ran the website. Um I managed a digital team of 20 which included writers, photographers, videographers. Um and we would publish on a daily basis. New content, whether that was videos um of social media posts or new articles. So on top of that I've also had a coordinator work under me before, even though I didn't have the formal manager position. Uh And I also even trained managers above me that have either been brought on after I've started um or have been brought on to replace a prior manager of mine. So I'm incredibly comfortable in a leadership position as well as comfortable um you know, teaching or leading a meeting or interviewing other people. It's all experience I've had before. So with all of these skills combined, um it really makes me a really strong product manager which with not only technical skills that are you know required to work with debs and engineers. Um I also have some of those softer skills like communicating in the weeds information to stakeholders and teams um that kind of live outside of that world. I'm also really comfortable using the software, the product managers use whether that's um gira or sauna, um you know, creating a roadmap, I've worked in agile and all of my jobs prior so again, not just the technical skills, not just the soft skills um also the corporate skills that I've gathered in my time in the workplace and that is why I would make a great product manager, I'd bring a lot to this company. Um and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. Thank you.

I'm very excited to be interviewing for this management position after having worked for this company for about six years now. I can say that I have definitely learned a lot by being in this environment. I have learned a lot from my manager and I've seen the way that she handled situations and have really learned how to take on those abilities as my own and as such. I really believe that I would make the perfect supervisory manager and be an asset to the team in terms of the skills and abilities I have through such a long period in this work, I've really learned how to handle clients and also my the people I work with, making sure that they all get along very well dealing with any kind of issues that may come up, having had that experience with clients and negotiating and compromising deals. I am keen to use those skills in terms of the management side and really use them too create a very cohesive workforce that really works together and uses all of its abilities to help the client. Furthermore, I have been told that I'm very personable having as I said, work for this company for many a year. I know everyone very well. I obviously maintained my integrity, I main professional boundaries, but I also I'm very close with everyone and I know how people, certain people like to work and I'm able to use those kinds of factors in the way that I delegate work or for example if I you know certain people are going on certain deals, being able to kind of negotiate that with everyone to know what they're strong. They're strongest abilities are and knowing how to use everyone to the like to the most of their ability so that we as a company and as a team come out on top as well as being in this company in a more junior role than this. I have had to make a lot of decisions and have been confided in by my manager to be able to make those sorts of decisions. And I think to be promoted to the role of manager would be a natural step as I already have learned how to make certain decisions when it comes to clients and the timings and meetings and I really think you know, I really know how to do this kind of thing. I'm adept at it and I'm very skilled at it and I am truly the right pick for this kind of job furthermore. You know, over five years you really get to grips with certain people's difficult periods. You know, certain clients when you have to compromise with them negotiate certain deals that they aren't really wanting to just being able to smooth talk them over is something that I have definitely had to deal with. And I think in that way that's definitely a transferable skill that I can use to help motivate and work with the team, make sure that the team works as a cohesive unit that works together for the client as opposed to against each other for selfish gain. And I really realized the importance of that teamwork in providing the best service that we can and really coming out on top in that term. Furthermore, I think knowing that everyone on a very professional level has allowed me to nowhere know how to help everyone personally and professionally, how to motivate them to be the very best person in work that they can be. And I think this is the most important skill because a manager is not nothing without their team as I have seen many a time and being able to motivate everyone individually and know exactly what it is that helps them become their very best is something that I know that sets me apart and something I have learned from my manager and I know that she is also very keen for me to be promoted to this role and she knows as well that I can do just as well as a job if not better than she has done because I have the knowledge, client base and also of everyone we work with. I you know, I'm very good at decisiveness, I make decisions, but I'm also able to make them quickly and effectively without sullying any other sort of work that we may have going on, I'm able to prioritize my time and lead everyone well and I think that is what makes me the perfect candidate for this role.

Um I've got almost 20 years of work experience and most of that time I've been managing teams um between one and three people, so relatively small teams. But um yeah I say I've been doing that for most of my career, I like to think that I'm a good manager work well with my teams, I would always try and make time for them. Um We would have regular want ones and team meetings and also try and do some social things so that we can bond as a team to try and be an empathetic, okay sort of compassionate manager and understand what people have got going on in their lives, but also to and you know, set that what the standards are that I'd expect from their work and to support them with delivering that. Um So I'd always try and make time, so if anybody's struggling then I would make the time to discuss with them. And I've got some experiences in my in my past work experience where I've had some poor performing team members and I've I have worked with them and actually being able to turn their their performance around. And some of that has been just through um really pinpointing where they're struggling. Some of it has been like playing different training that I've that I've gone on in the past, so just uh sort of looking at or what can they control how they communicate with people because sometimes actually the quality of the work is is okay, it's more just how they're they're communicating with stakeholders, so it would help them with that and how they would manage people's expectations and and as I say, give people more confidence in what they're doing. So I do have those experiences. I've also worked with some um really good performing team members. Um So that's been quite a different experience because then obviously you're trying to get the best out of that of that employee and sometimes that's about sort of encouraging them to do different training or different development or getting them involved with different projects. Um So this might be done discussing with my line manager what other things there might be available that my team member could get involved with so that you can continue to stretch them, make sure that they keep developing and that they don't get bored. So I've also had those experiences um I think the the most important thing for me and how I like to manage is is to be available and say to be supportive to work together on things so that and so that team members don't feel like they're just left to it. Um But at the same time not micromanaging, so I'd like to give them space to be able to get on with things, but if they do need the support then to make sure that I'm available and I have done different trainings over the years, so and some specific to managing people, but also looking at how I developed myself. So how I communicate with people, have difficult conversations with with people, and just really also how I understand how I sort of understand myself and what my strengths are, and to make sure that I make the most of of those.

I would say that I'm very democratic and I do believe that my mantra is people first task second, and I like to impair my team to lead and deliver to the best of their ability. I think I'm a really good leader, particularly under pressure. I'm used to working in a high stakes environment, I have a high level of attention to detail and I like to have the same skills evident within my team. I'm a big believer in succession planning and development and I use the personal development process, both as a mechanism to help me lead within my team um and to build future leaders within my team as well to ensure that there is a succession plan there and ultimately that there's somebody to come along eventually and take over from me in the role, working in assessment delivery in a university. We're used to working in a highly pressurized environment. I would say that I thrive in that environment and um I really do think I have the capacity to lead a diverse and large group of people in terms of my skills and abilities in respect of leadership development within my team. I used the PDB process, as I mentioned, the personal development plan process to try and build future leaders within that environment. I like to embed within our one on one meetings, a personal coaching and mentoring style so that I can provide leadership and guidance to my team as we work through our annual academic cycle. I'm also keen to ensure that we put some structured learning in place as well around leadership so that I can help my team develop their leadership skills and become leaders of the future. We do this through a monthly lunch and learn um scenario whereby either I or other content experts within the team will deliver short bursts of information and training on leadership and leading within the university and academic environment. In terms of um My own journey to leadership, I would say that I have honed and developed my leadership skills over really what is a 20-year career. I would say that I am not the leader I was when I started out, I am absolutely more person orientated now, I have more empathy now than when I started out and that's something really that I have um developed through experiential work based learning. I have of course undertaken formal leadership training throughout my career at various different stages, but really the quality learning has been in that experiential space whereby I've been able to take leadership theory and apply it to real life setting and contextualize it in terms of leadership and within the team. I don't think that one leadership style seats everybody as I said at the start, I'm quite democratic and how I how I approach and lead my team, but where I need to adapt that to specific people or personalities, I do that and I do that in a fair manner. I think some people require leadership that's very hands off that empowers them to strive and thrive themselves, whereas others need a more hands on approach and and really need to be coached to develop their own skills and their own context. I am a great believer that leadership is something that can be developed. We often hear the phrase natural born leaders, but I do think that everybody has the capacity to lead um and certainly everybody can be developed to lead um leadership. It doesn't always have to be about the person who's the latest in front and center. Um I have great respect in time for people who are quiet leaders and influencers within a team. And I do try to pick out those people with my own team and develop them and build their confidence so they can take that quiet leadership and apply it to the benefit of of of all that we do within our department. Probably I think one of the really important things about being a good leader is having the ability to admit when you've made a mistake or you've done something wrong, I'm a big believer in quality improvement and I think as a team leader, when you make an error or you do something that maybe it wasn't the best that that you could have given to a task or project that you hold your hand up and you say, you know, I made a mistake here, here's why I made the mistake. Here's what I learned from the mistake. And here are the mechanisms that I can put in place to ensure that I don't make that mistake again. In the future. I do try to empower my team to own significant events, own mistakes and use them as a learning opportunity to ensure that we all perform better, more efficient and to a higher level the next time.",POSITIVE,0.9631,0.0003,0.0362,0.0004,857.0,LOW,5,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),18.81,1,0,0,"Master's degree (e.g. MA, MS, MEd)",Female,8.939351,9.256842,8.956284

I very much hope that during this five minute interview I will be able to convince you of the skills and attributes that I possess which will make me suitable for this position and that I will demonstrate that I have the aptitude and the desire and the ability to take our center of learning and development into the future As you will well know from my CV. I have 20 years of experience in teaching and learning. When I first started working in this center, we didn't have very much in the way of computer capacity. In fact we still used overhead projectors. It makes me feel very old to recount that, but it just sort of shows how far we have come In a 20 year period. Um because of all of my experience, I suppose I have taught a number of groups both in class and online um and in a variety of situations for where it was nursing education, multidisciplinary education, continuous professional development. And the reason I bring my teaching experience into this is that I think a manager um in this position needs to be very aware, needs to be a very skilled and experienced educated themselves so that they can relate to their colleagues and really lead in terms of ensuring that we have the best resources for teaching and learning available to all staff. The second thing I would like to highlight is my ability to collaborate and to work well with diverse groups of people as you may well be aware. I was involved in the project team to develop the consortium Of centers for the past two years, this was a huge body of work and it involved collaborating with colleagues from 18 other centers across the country. Um obviously I did not do this in a manager capacity, I did it in my current role as as a nurse tutor, but I really felt that at that time I got a very good insight into how policies and processes have to be robust to help a center to work well. I have a very good idea of the governance and the policies and procedures and guidelines that have been developed for the consortium and where each center of learning and development sits within it. And so therefore I feel that I am very well equipped to lead this center into its new role as part of this exciting new consortium and to argue our case for ensuring that the programs that we deliver, our programs that we feel proud of, that we have ownership of and that we have the strengths and the manpower to teach. Another thing in relation to collaboration, I suppose would be my people skills and I very much hope that I have demonstrated in my years of experience my capacity to engage with obviously students, but more importantly, um in relation to management with my coworkers and my colleagues and other educators and other staff across the wider hospital. I've been told it's quite a strength of mine that I have very good interpersonal skills and that I have a warm and engaging manner and that that, combined with my knowledge, means that I'm a fair and impartial arbitrator when it comes to maybe dealing with situations that are a little bit challenging, a little bit difficult or not quite one of the mill situations. I do think it's very important for a good manager to have those sorts of skills, people skills, to be able to relate to people, to be able to enjoy working with people and to be able to ensure that, um, the work gets done and that everybody feels that they're being treated fairly and kindly, um, and that in this particular center, which is growing its abilities in a range of areas that people feel that they have somebody at the helm who understands what is happening. And my final um, justification for this position is to tell you about my recent studies in relation to digital learning design. Since the pandemic. Obviously we've had to move a lot of our teaching to online platforms and used a blended learning approach. I have done this recent course in digital learning design and I feel I'm very well equipped to take us to the next stage",POSITIVE,0.9058,0.0021,0.0911,0.0011,747.0,MED,10,99.0,2.0,Using only (2),14.38,1,0,0,"Master's degree (e.g. MA, MS, MEd)",Female,8.498494,8.823922,9.054511

Um firstly I have a wealth of experience in mentoring, I started this during school um and have continued it to this date um present the mental thing that I do is for students who are applying for either scholarships to get onto the bar course um or uh students applying to university or for pupil EGX, which is a job specific to barristers. So I've had a lot of success with this. A lot of my mentees have been successful in obtaining scholarships um and they've I've also had many be successful in obtaining people or places at university and I believe that this is largely down to my mentoring ability, I think that's a highly transferrable skill to um to a leadership role in this organization because the same skills are required of empathy and relating to people um as well as um communication skills, which I think is really important for a management role because it's important to convey the right message is. Um as well as my mentoring, I was also a vice President of the society called Student minds Cambridge during my time at university and this really allowed me to develop my leadership skills as well. So alongside the president, I managed a team of around 15 people on our committee and I was responsible for taking leadership meetings when the president was away deciding strategy alongside the president and managing the various roles within the committee to ensure that our overall objectives were met. This was quite a significant role, there was a lot of work to do and it was throughout the whole academic year and also during my final year, which as you can imagine, was quite busy as well. Um However we were very successful in our year, we won an award for student minds campaign group of the year through our campaigning that we did on campus for better, better mental health facilities for students. Um We also had a very successful and harmonious team which I think was down to our leadership abilities. Um So through roles like this I've developed my leadership abilities. I would describe my style as quite friendly and usually quite informal. Um And I think that's the best way to manage other people. Um Nobody likes to feel like they're being spoken down to. So I like to try and relate to people on a sort of more human level and talk to them as an equal, and I think that's the best way to get the message across and that's something that I've done throughout all of my leadership roles. The final role that I'd like to mention is that I was a student representative during my time at the University of Law on the M. A. Law course. This involved liaising with external and internal stakeholders to convey messages that the student body wanted to put across, such as suggestions and feedback on the course. Um So that was another leadership role that I feel that I excelled at. Um And again, this was a successful role for me because we were able to implement some of the student body's ideas. Um So all of this has has culminated in my experience as a manager, and I think the next step is for me to take on a management role in this organization.",POSITIVE,0.9091,0.0076,0.0414,0.0418,587.0,LOW,6,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),5.72,1,0,0,"Bachelor's degree (e.g. BA, BS)",Female,8.742216,9.063479,8.831074

First of all, I wanted to thank you for taking the time to meet with me so we can discuss how I would be a good fit in the managerial department for your company. I have 22 years of leadership experience in the education field and I think that experience has helped me to develop a lot of skills that are very important in a leader. I have worked with many teams in the past and when working with teams, everybody in the entire team does need to feel important and that's you know, a sincere feeling of importance. Um you know, sincere praise to a person, give everyone time to come up with an idea, don't criticize a person's ideas because it's obviously important to that person. Um one of the main skills I would say for a manager is really to listen, let the speaker, the team members talk more than the manager does, and that's really an important skill to have with anything in life is to be a good listener, also restate what you heard, so that the team member can also feel like a valued member of the team and that I captured their idea incorrectly. Um Also when leading, you always want to Put your leadership team 1st. So when I was a department manager and a science department, I would always put my team members schedules first according to what they would prefer, what we might have talked about, one on one. So I will schedule their preferences for them to teach first and then usually whatever classes are left over. Those are the ones that I will pick up. So I want my team members to know that they are my priority and I will always try to schedule them with the best fit for them. Um Also there are times when dealing with the team that some team members will be wrong, but you never want to say directly or to come out and say that's wrong. It's like, oh, terrible idea, you want to kind of plant ideas. So the other person is listening thinking maybe well if we could maybe do it this way, we could still come up with the same product that we were talking about. But it would take less time. It would be less costly. So, you know, you don't want to ever tell somebody that's wrong. That's no because that can make them a little bit of defensive, A little bit resistant to change. So we're just going to work our way around the problem saying, well what about this? Make this work and then listen to the team member two. Hopefully guide them to get um the correct route in solving the problem. Always want to, you know, with me, I've always start my meetings in a friendly way. You know, just a little bit of chit chat. If I know somebody's son or daughter was ill, I'll ask about them and again, this is to make the team members more comfortable. I feel that they are important, but it's you know, for the manager or leader that needs to be done in a very sincere way. They will be able to see right through you if you've done it, if you know, insincere or you've kind of faked it. Um, also, you know, you don't give direct orders and say, okay, team member one, you are going to do this project and it has to be done in the next six hours. Um, so don't give the direct orders but say, okay, here's the project that we have and we have this amount of time to complete it in. So asking members, how are we going to be able to complete this on time within budget? So ask them for ideas?",POSITIVE,0.9467,0.0002,0.0528,0.0003,641.0,HIGH,11,99.0,2.0,Using only (2),14.46,1,0,0,"Master's degree (e.g. MA, MS, MEd)",Female,8.522493,8.84772,8.797257

So previously in this role, I've had to work as an interim manager for the team. So I had to basically motivate and join team meetings every single friday morning and essentially make sure that our team was on track record to be getting in the sales that we needed. Um so obviously it's a very difficult job, we always get new recruits, there's a lot of time over, um and you need to have the ability to actually motivate a team and make sure that they know where they're going, you know what they're doing and the best way to do that is to inspire them. So I myself have actually been very successful in this role as everyone knows, I think I am top of the leaderboard every single week, so I do understand how difficult it is to get there though, and the hard work that you put in, and I think that coming across um in this way to the team members, especially the new recruits that we so often get would be um Two would be really beneficial for them to see that actually the hard work does pay off and that they can get to a position where they're bringing in like 14 million every year um, onto the sales board onto the leaderboard and um all you have to do is be determined put in the work and you kind of, you get out of this job, what you put in and I think that that is the most inspiring and motivating things that I would bring to the managerial position. Um I think that is, yeah, definitely an essential part of being a leader um and it's something that I really value as part of my own set of skills essentially is to inspire and motivate the team. We want to have bad managers and what they can be like and um nothing worse. Yeah, I think that's probably the two best skills in that sense. Additionally, I have extra relationship building skills and a huge network to date. So um we all know that as part of this role we need to be able to build substantial relationships and actually maintain them as well with our leads and with our clients and our investor base um to ensure that our reputation is upheld at the company and um and as well as that, you know, to to drip feed that through the team as well that I would then manage to ensure they have the same skill set and to ensure that they are being trained up to the same level that they need to be um as the rest of us leaders to to ensure that they, you know, get the most out of their position out of the company. So definitely relationship building skills um and understanding what makes that happen. So how do you actually build those relationships with people um obviously in order to be able to train people and lead a team, you need to understand it yourself and I do have a really strong track record of that um as my network has grown over the years at this company um it's something that I'm very proud of and I would really like to instill those same skills within my future team and it'll be really exciting for me. Um so definitely that as well um and in terms of other leadership skills that I've gotten qualities, I think that I'm a really determined person um I think it's great to have the attitude that, you know, you should be stunned but also supportive and you should be someone that people can actually approach and talk to. And I think that's quite overlooked because obviously these days with like mental health as well with all the things with Covid that have been going on, I think it's really, really important to ensure that people feel listened to, acknowledged and they feel supported as part of the team. And I think there there are qualities that I naturally do have. So for example, um in terms of being empathetic, I have demonstrated numerous times that I have an empathetic nature within the company. So I always helping people where I can extending myself working overtime trying to make people people's lives easier in the in the job. So yeah, that's definitely another thing as well. I think that that's something that I really do bring to the team as a personable person. My interpersonal skills are are definitely proven throughout this job. Um yeah, in terms of myself with the other team members and I think that, you know, myself and colleagues worked really well together in a collaborative setting. And yeah, I'd be really looking forward to implementing those skills um in in my future team and leading it and hoping that, you know, it would be a successful partnership and so I can motivate the next generation of sales teams are successful within our company.

And we were, although she was a rung below me, we were very treated her very much as an equal.

I have manager skills from my previous role, albeit in a different setting and I was a supervisor, An Italian restaurant for four years and that enabled me to gain the managerial skills and that that have set me up for future work like this role. So I know the importance of getting on with the team, having a friendly attitude, being approachable. Um I'm not afraid of speaking to people, not sure at all confident. Um I know how to drive the team forward and we were in a very successful restaurant where I worked and it was very busy and had a lot of roles to manage the team to help out. I was in charge of obviously opening and closing the restaurant, so it's a big responsibility to have it, to have the keys and to have to organize all the money and things.

I feel like I'm approachable person, I'm a positive person as well. And so I think that's a really good asset to have um as a manager because you want to drive sales, you want to succeed. Like we're doing very, very well at the moment, but we need to keep that memento going and I think I can do that. I think the skills that I've learned in my previous manager role can definitely be put into this role. So yeah, I'm kind, I'm caring, which I think is the most important thing. I've also been on courses already at that time here and which were for like kind of managerial roles already um about like having those difficult, difficult discussions with staff and grasping the nettle, as you say, um you know, nipping it in the board straight away if somebody's not performing and then obviously going through the motions and if it leads to a disciplinary or whatever. So I think that cost was really beneficial for me in terms of that, I now have those have now have that knowledge to put into action with the team.

It's something that I'm really excited about. I believe that I'm a really good people manager and I think this role would be something that I would excel in. So briefly, just a little bit about me, I did a business management degree back at university and which I achieved a first class honors award and I really enjoyed the management, the people management side of the course, which really sort of focused me in my career and I left university, um having been the captain of our women's soccer slash football team, which again, it was a role that I really enjoyed and they were university and as a team captain and leader, people were relying on me for direction in doing so. I was also very wary and considered about making sure that everybody felt galvanized as a team. Um, I wouldn't just um use the extroverts opinions and take them on board and, and run with that. I would make sure that the more quiet members of the team who more often than not would have something really valid to say in terms of strategy um, and direction of the team were involved and I think that was a real and real good example of leadership because we went from being and the bottom half of the league table the previous season. And then when I took over as the captain, we were second in the league, so it was, it was a really good team effort and I feel like I really galvanized the team and to make that happen. And I left university and I joined a graduate placement within the retail industry. Again, I wanted to focus on people management and leadership and that's something really important to me because I'm so passionate about it. And so I joined a retailer and I was the area manager responsible for between six and 10 at any one time individual retail stores. So I would have store managers reporting to me and I would ultimately be responsible for the sales and productivity of those stores. And it was really important part of the role too, make sure that the managers were happy because there was 100% correlation between the happiness and well being of the managers and staff of those stores. Um and the actual sales and productivity of those stores to, that was something that I picked up on very, very quickly and it was just so obvious and clear um that you need to have happy star and they will work for you and they will do a fantastic job. Not only that we make some great friends along the way and some really solid relationships that I still have to this day sort of five years later and I was quickly promoted from area manager to a director level um at the same business. And so I now have a team of five managers that report to me And there are subordinates. I have about 15 subordinates as well below those managers. Again, this is more an office based role with the same retail company, so it is a slight change of pace, but they are clear targets that I have to meet, not just in terms of productivity and KPI s but in terms of employee well being and health with that in mind, with that being a really strong focus for the business. I enrolled myself on a mental health first aid course and so I'm now a mental health practitioner at work. Um and again I think you can never underestimate an employee's well being and health and enjoyment of the role and making sure they're in the right role at the right time in the right place. And if all those things aligned then it's very clear to me like an evidence base it that the results of the team or the company. So um it's as simple as that really and I think a lot of people do miss that. So that would be my main focus people and their well being.

I believe that I have the skills required to take on the management position in your company and will be excited for a new challenge in this world. So for the past five years I've been working within the civil service where I've managed a range of different people, um a lot of diversity and the people that I have managed and from this, I've recognized the importance of taylor in my management and leadership sell to cater to the needs of these individuals. So some examples of um stuff that I imagine the past includes one member who was new to the organization. So needed a lot more sort of guidance and needed to build up their knowledge to be able to carry out the work required of them in the role. Um, so this involved a lot more of a hands on approach for myself, giving them guidance, having a lot more regular check ins and catch up with them to check in on progress and check they got any questions for myself. And also to try and encourage that sort of learning over, take them through some sort of coaching. So ask, let them sort of do the talking or asking questions too, try and trigger them to sort of to generate the results for themselves um which has been quite useful and we'd like to put up my skills in that a bit more in the future, other members of staff. I've had, I've been a lot more experience than myself, which takes off different side of the few here, They needed a lot less, got more less guidance to get them through the role, but they just kind of needed pointers or a bit of a sort of direction and what what way the work should be going. Um but I think with this member of staff it was key for me to push for opportunities for them to develop themselves and go for the higher job grade. So to do this, I would some question where oh tricks asked them about or how they would like to develop and where they see themselves moving in the future in terms of their career and try and put them forward for opportunities, like give them presentations or attending conferences and networking with other members of staff to try and get the skills to do this. I currently manage a team of three people and one of the things that I always try and have in place is having clear team goals or objectives mainly, so everyone knows exactly what they're working towards and it encourages a bit more of collaboratively working within the team and also everyone, everyone knows what they're doing. It just creates a better working environment for everyone. Another key aspect of leadership that I've developed over the last few years is the plan inside of things, so it's important to have a clear structure and no, and the team to know exactly what's expected of them and deadlines in place just so everyone knows what what exactly they need to be doing. And allows us also an opportunity to move around deadlines if if needed or move around reprioritized tasks if anyone has fallen behind or anyone is taken sick leave for example. I think it's also important at being a leader to give good, constructive feedback too. My staff, so not only mentioned when it's going well but also when it's not going so well and how they can improve it. On the flip side of that, I would also encourage my members of staff to give me feedback to let me know how I can improve because that's important to know meeting the needs that they require for me as well as proving and developing myself as well. I also think it's really important to be approachable and friendly because you don't want to have a manager or a leader who you can't go up to and voice any opinions or worries. So that's quite important. I think I've also did it through my lead through more time. It's cos, well I've developed my leadership skills not only a management management staff but also feeding on projects, project management as well as delivery of presentations in front of wide audiences which has all helped increase my confidence and skill set. So I think I would be a successful candidate for your position and I will look forward to hearing back from you thank you",POSITIVE,0.708,0.0003,0.2914,0.0002,774.0,MED,8,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),13.35,1,0,0,"Master's degree (e.g. MA, MS, MEd)",Female,9.448988,9.762199,9.651155

I am continuously reading and also watching material that enables me to to know how to communicate with the team. I'm also good at adapting, adapting to go to different cultures, different corporate cultures, different company cultures, different personality types. Because it's important to know who you work with and to be able to adapt to that because as a leader you will be working with this team and for the only way to to make it a success is to adapt to what you find. So for instance if a colleague is from a different ethnic group and in that particular ethnic group they are unable to do certain things. You need to be able to take that into cognizance when you are busy. Um delegating tasks Which brings me to my 3rd 1 which is um um graded multitask or other graded um delegating because as a leader you will be able to, I think the most important skill to possess is delegation skills, knowing when to delegate what to who is as imperative to the team as knowing how to communicate with your team. So um being able to delegate is what I'm good at, it's also something that I read on, work on and continuously learning how to be better at delegating because knowing how to to to pick and choose tasks to fit the different personality types in your team is important. So knowing what each individual team member is good at and what they're not so good at. It's also important because um the individual team members and their contribution needs to be at their best ability. So knowing who is good at what will enable you to delegate particular tasks to particular people and that will help the team go further. I'm also good at multitasking, knowing how to be a leader and also a team player or other a member of the team. It's also important, it's important that you understand that some of your duties might overlap with those of your team members or other those of your team. So a good leader is able to be a leader lead to the team and also work as part of the team and I'm also good in teamwork. I'm able to work as an individual on my own, leading the team from outside, but also to work as part of the team because in this team, if I'm honored and I'm working in the team as a team member, it will also you smile and also make the team members um more willing to work. That's what I believe anyways. I believe that if team members don't see themselves only as a subordinates but you can also see you as a team member, they will be able to come to you for not only advice but also um you know with whatever concerns worries because if your team is unable to come to you, the team suffers as a whole, the team suffers. So I believe also that it's important that your team members know that you're not only this leader, this person is working in isolation there who is the boss, but instead they should see you as a team member so that they can treat you as one so that they will be able to relate to you as one. You know, I also believe that um knowing how to um solve problems is important. So problem solving skills is another thing that I also possess and I believe that it's an important one and one that I am constantly trying to improve on because your inability to critically think about an issue and to come to a creative solution, you know, innovative solution to it and killed the team. So I believe that it's important to have good problem solving skills which is what I possess as a leader. And it's also something that I'm continuously working on because I do not believe that you will be able to move forward as a team if you are unable to solve problems everyday problems that you might encounter.

I've been through all of that. I worked as an essential worker during the first lockdown and it really opened my eyes to the way the company was run. It also gave me some hands on experience at every level within the company, not just at my level as I was taking phone calls, everything up to to my job, working very closely with manager at that point. Previous to working in optics, I was a PhD student and my project management skills were really honed during that that period of four years where I was allocated certain resources, I had to manage my own time. I had to manage other people's time. You know, what coordinates um students as well as reporting to higher ups, which is, you know, something that managers have to do. They also have management regional managers, um and people within the company that are looking at the overall picture.

I've got a good understanding of what it takes to um to schedule staff to to make sure there's enough cover. And also to anticipate any challenges that arise. As I said, you know, illness is something that we're dealing with a lot just now. We're permanently understaffed because of it. And I feel that this is something that could be, that could be um, I learned from going forward, you know, for for covid how to staff properly and maybe having extra staff as a backup just in case where, you know, someone calls in sick. I um, I like to lead by example, which is um, something that I've always done when I've worked with people, I've always set a good example of, I've modeled good behavior and a good positive attitude. So I don't look at things as negative. I look at things as challenges to be overcome. There's always a solution. All we need to do is define the problem. Well, mm hmm. We have a lot of issues at the moment in the, in the industry, one of the issues is obviously online sales and I think what we need to do is embrace that more so as a manager, I think it's important to be very aware of the challenges and to make our team also aware of the challenges and what we provide over and above what's available, you know, cheaper elsewhere. So we have a premium service. We want to make sure that customers from start to finish experience a premium service and that means that they will get more value for the, for the money coming to us rather than going somewhere else. That's cheaper. But maybe it doesn't have the same customer service. I'm very patient, customer orientated. I believe that, you know, establishing good relationships with people will cause them to come back. They will keep coming back to us if they feel that they're they're understood and heard as a person. I also have that approach with the staff. I get to know them as people, I get to know that their strengths and their weaknesses and I would then try and work with them on those weak points, um, in a way that they felt supported, especially when you have any weaknesses, you always are we, but um, yeah, you feel a bit exposed when talking about them to other people and maybe there's no confidence there. That's why you haven't really looked at developing yourself. So, bye bye. You know, supporting staff in order to get the training, they need to overcome any weaknesses, meaning they're they're good all round. We don't just have people working in their little niche. We have people who can work in any sort of role within our our environment means that during this, this time of uncertainty when we have people who maybe have to take time off at short notice, they were not worried about having their job not done for a few days because everybody can do the roll, everybody can do everybody else's role and because everyone can do everyone else's role, it means that we have a greater understanding of what everyone in the team does.

So I kind of want to talk to you a bit about why I think I'm best positioned for the role. So first of all I've played football, so I'm 23, I played football since I was about eight or 9 years old um Unless you played it all my life, it's really big hobby of mine, really enjoy it, but more so from the enjoyment, I get a lot of skills and ability from it. I've been able to take on further in later life and through jobs. So the main thing is playing football, you're a team player, you learn to work as a team, it's not just individual, it's not about you. I think that's really important. Taking into the workplace isn't just about one person, you got to work as a cohesive team um and you learn a lot about that through sport, but most importantly when I've been playing football is I've been captain. Um so I played at county level where I was captain and I played at university for two years where I was captain of the team that requires a lot more responsibility than just playing on the team, especially uni, you had to organize the team organized practice, organize people's kit, et cetera. So from that point of view, you could say being a captain is kind of like being a bit of a managing role of the team and that's given me a lot of experiences, like sorting people out, making sure there's cohesion, like making sure people are, where they're meant to be sort of making sure everyone performs two, they're like the best of their ability and I think that you can most definitely take this through to, so the managing role that you're proposing, I think them skills are very transferable. Um So not only that, but also I've mentored a lot of students in high school, so um we had to mentor some younger people, teach them, not teach them how to read, but sort of there reading maybe wasn't as good as it should have been and we kind of had to like make sure that I got to a better level and I think through mentoring someone, you know, you're kind of like a leader, you know, managing them, making sure they're where they're gonna be in sort of their education, so again, that's another like transferable skill. Um I think one of my best abilities that I think it really is good for sort of this managing rollers, I'm very calm levelheaded, so I think in a lot of sort of high pressure situations or stressful situations, a lot of people can lose their head and not think realistically or rationally, whereas I think I'm quite the opposite, I think when it gets them situations, I think I perform better in high pressure stressful situations um and I sort of am able to think rationing sort of keep a calm head and keep level headed, which I think is what you really need for managing role because as a manager you have a lot of responsibility on your shoulders and you know you can't really be affording sort of um to lose your head with customers or with team players, you know you have to lead by example and I think playing football and mentoring students, I think that's all a great example of leading by example you are a role model um and I think that I've really exemplified this through my past experience. Another ability I think I have is time management, good organization skills. So obviously as a manager um you need to be really organized, you need to know what people are doing rotors etcetera, um deliveries and stuff like that, you need to know when they're coming in. Well obviously with all the things that I just told you about, you have to be very organized with your time and especially bouncing my education. So my gcc is my A. Levels and my uni work whilst also playing football at times to a really high level. I really had to balance my time and make sure that was getting my work done and being able to go to matches. So yeah, I think all in all I definitely have the abilities, the experience and the skill required to be in this managing role",POSITIVE,0.747,0.0093,0.2341,0.0096,751.0,LOW,6,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),14.31,1,0,0,"Bachelor's degree (e.g. BA, BS)",Female,8.928057,9.245643,8.904968

Um so the reason I feel I would be an effective manager and I should be getting the position is um there's a couple of things I've learned throughout my time and sales, what makes an effective leader and what um gets really good responses from your team. So two things that I think I'm very good at as well as I think it has big results when it comes to managing a team is one um just being consistent, that sounds simple, but I saw a lot of people, especially new people when they joined the team. If they didn't have a very consistent manager, you weren't always sure what attitude you were going to get or what strategy they might tell you. Sometimes there's a lot of changes and they weren't transparent. So I think just consistency and a manager, um it provides comfort to the team, you always know what you're getting. Um It just creates a level of stability and also a level of trust there because things aren't being switched up on you, so consistency is for sure, one that I think I'm very effective at um bringing every day and I just know it gives very good results to a team when you just have a consistent manager, even if there's sometimes things that um employees aren't loving to hear, just the consistency can create a lot of trust there. So um that's one of the huge ones. Second being um I guess transparency and willing to work with people um as a manager, I don't think there's one way that everything has to be done. I think a lot of people have different skills and different areas of strengths and weaknesses. So I like to always approach it in um talking to them like a human, figuring out what really works for them, what they struggle with and just keeping it a very open line of communication, so we can figure out the best way to get it done. Um and I think willing to work with people also gives a feeling of comfort on a team and feeling of um you can really figure out how you can do this to the best of your ability instead of feeling like you're stuck in one place. So I think both of those in taking a team to the next level, it creates a sense of unity, a sense of trust with you and people are overall reaching their full potential more if you're trying to work with them. So those two things I think make me a very effective manager. The other couple of things is I have had a lot of experience in the sales role, some things I was always good at in a position before management was analyzing my process. I think that is hugely important and I always stress it to my team members, especially with sales, you're always gonna start to get in a groove with things, especially once you get going and you know what you're talking about, you know what you're selling, but there's always holes in your process and if you don't step back to see where am I not converting things, where am I missing? Um, if you don't have those moments where you self reflect and analyze, you kind of get stuck or plateau, you don't keep growing. So, um, that's kind of what made me be a top performer in sales and get myself to management and I think that's super important to just always self reflect. So that's something I always stressed in my team. Just take a couple of minutes each day, take an hour each week, sit back, look at your weekly goals, monthly goals, yearly goals. So I think a lot of things that I picked up on and what made me a good performer I like to implement to my teams. So that as well as the two things I talked about, open communication and consistency, all of those combined, I think I would be a very, um, strong candidate for this role and could do um, a lot of good things in that management position.

I believe in communication first and foremost in order for anything to work in life, there has to be communication. I believe in one on one meetings. I believe in group meetings. I believe in supervisor meetings. I believe in when a person is new or season, everyone needs a refresher of the organizational goals was expected of how to achieve them accurately and appropriately according to the policy and procedures. I believe that communication should be open on both ends, not just the supervisor going to the subordinate. I believe that subordinates should be able to come to the supervisor anytime. They should never feel like that they're afraid or intimidated just because you're the superior. Um, without communication, there is chaos. I believe the rules and regulations need to be communicated or even issues. Maybe the person's having personal issues and it's affecting the way that they perform their job duties. I believe that they should feel comfortable enough that they can come to you and discuss this and then we can then as a team, you can work around the situation and communicate how to, how to be effective with it. Um, I also believe in having positive communication, not just communication when there's something wrong. I mean if if a person is doing great, let them know they're doing great. It doesn't always have to be, you're doing this wrong, It needs to be done this way. You need to just sit down and say, hey, you know, I never thought, you know, we can do it this way, thanks for the tip. You know, can you spread it to the other people on shift or would you mind if we implement this? Um I believe in motivation. Each job requires stress. Most jobs require some type of stress and I believe that we should motivate have days where we can do things that are, are implement procedures that are policies that we can do things to help motivate each other. Um Maybe have a morale committee, you know, every so often have a company picnic or or a day where we'll have a pot look or have employee of the month, have a raffle for gift cards. Everybody can use a gift card, especially a gas gift cards. Um I believe in um delegating duties, I don't believe in putting all the work on one person, the duties should be delegated, we're at the end of shift that everybody feels like if they contributed to the success of that day And not 1, 1 person should not feel like their burden with everything. Everybody should have their own load to fulfill. Um I believe in being positive just because something bad happened doesn't mean that it's not going to be a positive outcome. That's just a lesson for the rest of us not to do the same thing or or find another way to do it. So that same situation will not happen again. Um I believe in being trustworthy, not only should you have to be able to trust your staff, but your staff, Your staff should be able to trust you to trust that whatever they tell you, you're gonna always keep their best interests at hand. And as well as the company, um, when someone trusts you, they're comfortable and sometimes things are not as bad as people think they are, but if they hold it and, and if they're afraid to say something, it can, it can get out of hand. So I want myself debated. Trust me and that's what I believe in. Um, I believe in the open door policy also. Um, maybe being, create creativity. Um, find another way to do. You know, we're, we all have one common goal to get the job done, but if there's a creative way, we can do it and make it fun. Hey, let's do that. Um, feedback. I want feedback also not only do I want to give them feedback, I want them, give me feedback saying, hey, I learn better if I'm hands on, I learn better. If I have the instructions written down, everybody has room to grow. Not only just your staff, but you also as a leader, um, you have to know also believe in, you have to be something worth following in order to be a leader. You have to be an example, a good example for your staff because you don't want to leave them in the wrong direction, depending on the field that you're in, someone can get hurt or someone could get fired.

Obviously to take such a role as a managing position is a huge, huge responsibility as you would be leading a bunch of people that you've never met before and with that comes with different personalities and different opinions and as a leader you would have to be able to delegate your team into doing the task at hand, you know um I think one of the most obvious attributes as a leader, as a good leader is the ability to listen to your team. You know, your employees have multiple opinions and they would also love to contribute their ideas when it comes to things that you come up with, so you have to be able to listen to them whenever they feel like they want to add a point to something or they are not satisfied or happy about something, you know, you have to have the ability to really listen and find a way to come up with to find a solution to it, you know and obviously do that in a controlled manner and then you would make the final decision as you are the leader, you know, but with that also comes being able to be strategic, you know, you have to come up with solutions on the spot and in a way that it would be pleasing for everybody and that it doesn't compromise anyone else, which also comes in being fair and honest. Um sometimes they will be put, there will be situations where um certain people are put in compromising situations or a decision was made and it negatively affected another employee, so you have to be able to have the ability to try to find a middle ground that they were all your decisions impact all your employees in a good manner. Um I would like to consider myself as a creative, which I think is very underrated attributes as a leader because sometimes you have to, you are going to be put in situations where you have to come up with ideas on the spot. This also ties down to having vision and motivation, you know, whichever task that your team is doing, sometimes you can feel that people are not motivated, they're not really interested in the tasks, which is where being creative comes in, so you have to come up with a creative way to keep your employees engaged in whatever task they're doing as well as the workplace and show that they are the space that they're in, it's very comfortable, creative and stimulating because sometimes things can get a bit boring, so you have to have the ability to really lift your employees up and the spirit because yes, life can be challenging sometimes, so as a leader, you have to also take that into consideration, which also ties back into listening. Um one of Mhm, A very underrated attribute as well as the ability to connect with your team, you know, some people just feel as if they need to just have a uh employer employee relationship, you know, the set certain boundaries of I'm above you in terms of levels, so therefore we don't need to have any sort of relationship, but I do think that you have to connect with your employees because it will just creates a better working relationship where they'll be trust. So whenever they have a problem they won't feel scared to come up to you to tell you they're having issues, which is why you also have to know how to listen. Um it also creates a better environment because now you do personally know your employees, but obviously there is a level of boundary but you can say, you know employees, you know where their strengths and weaknesses are, which is why you would get to know them and to understand and then they will be able to tell you where they would love to take on more responsibility in certain tasks that you give them because sometimes you don't want to put people in uncomfortable situations, which is why when you start connecting, you will learn about all these different things about your employees. Um I think that becoming a leader is a huge responsibility. So one of the attributes is the ability to take accountability for your actions. You know, as a leader, you're not always going to be right, you are going to make mistakes on the way and you have to be able to take accountability for your actions and tell your team that, you know, I think I was wrong and apologize and do things in a proper manner. You know, because it is sometimes the case of monkey See monkey. Do you know, if you are able to come correct to your employees and show them that you made a mistake and when they make a mistake, they will be able to come up to you and tell you that that makes it without it having been a big issue.

Um During this role, I had to lead a group of volunteers um on our engagement events, um which are events where the patient give their feedback um regarding their experiences at the hospital and what the company that worked for uh aimed for.

Um I pride myself on being able to get the best out of individuals. I think it's really, really important to be flexible and adaptable to be able to do that. Um I really do quite rely heavily on understanding personality types and I don't know if you've heard of, like the blue, red, yellow and green, but you know, like for example, a red person is very competitive, so you would do well to set them target. Um and that really helps to get the best out of people, and honestly, when you have a happy team and you figure out how to get the best out of people and that's when you have a an environment um and a culture whereby people thrive, they enjoy working for you, they want to deliver the results for you and the company. Um So I think that's really, really important. I'm very, very, very passionate about being able to be clear about our goals and our vision. Each and every individual in my team must understand the role they play in. Um We're meeting the objectives of our strategic vision and I really do reinforce that how I do that is through one to ones. We also have several opportunities to meet. Um as a group, we have, you know, weekly team meetings, we have bi bi weekly stand ups which are a lot quicker and sharper just to make sure that everybody is up to date. Um and in check in terms of, you know, managing individuals, I think it's really important to get to know your to get to know your employees to have that open door policy, to create an environment that feels trusting one that's got mutual respect. Um and also just to work with individuals on their individual goals and development plans, that is really important. No one's gonna, you know, produce high quality work if they don't feel valued and if they don't feel that they have a clear, powerful progression. So, you know, I'm very, very much passionate about getting to know individuals um ensuring that, you know, I understand where they're at, where they want to go, but I give, you know, very timely feedback about, you know, possible areas of development um and how to do that in a constructive and an offensive way, but it is obviously important to make sure that people are carrying out the roles to the best of their ability and it's important that I as a leader, um I'm able to explain if and when that's not the case, and then I have done that on several occasions, you know, I've had to put I've had to put people on disciplinary, we've had to have weekly check ins um and, you know, we've had to take it through hR disciplinary stages, I'm more than capable of doing so, and I really really think that, you know, in terms of managing individuals, you need to make sure that you give them timely feedback feedback that that they can implement, and but not only give them feedback that they can implement, but ensure that it's actually being implemented. Um outside of that, I think it's really good if you can to have a strong and cohesive team to come to foster a fund working environment. So the way that we might do that is to, you know, I've done silly things like socks of the week, so we nominate someone who has had the most wackiest or fun socks of the week. Um you know, we recognize people by gifting if necessary, where they've done amazing work. Um you know, we really take a lot of time to get together as a team, make sure that we know where everybody's at and that, you know, we're able to really foster a fun and developing a fun and dynamic environment, you know, aside from that, it's really up to me to sort of keep in touch with the direction of the organization to ensure that I'm clear on my manager's objectives for the department and that I cascade that down to my team members appropriately, I've got really good experience of being able to do that. I really think it's important that we set the vision that we're all singing off the same hymn sheet. Um and that everyone understands what they're there to do and why it's important, um and and why they feel valued, but actually, if, if they don't understand what we're there to do when I really do pride myself and have an open door policy where they can come and speak to me and be themselves and to question and challenge me, I'm a person just as much as the next person, Hey, that's my fault.",POSITIVE,0.7975,0.0085,0.0983,0.0957,836.0,LOW,4,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),15.16,1,0,0,"Bachelor's degree (e.g. BA, BS)",Female,8.858882,9.177049,9.173682

This was a real baptism of fire, really kind of thrown in at the deep end because somebody went on long term second, I was asked to step up and lead this team. So this gave me a lot of hands on experience of the kind of day to day Netted City management, so your basic HR function, so things like dealing with annual leave requests, um sick leave, back to work interviews, maternity and flexible working requests, all those kind of things. I was responsible for the data handling within the section. So these were this was a benefit application, so there's a lot of really personal information we have to really, you know, keep an eye on how we were, we were storing it irish, responsible for both the quality and the quantity of the claims that were processed in the section. So that meant I had to interact with a number of different sections to get information about how much was being turned over, as well as information about the pass rate of the stuff that we're dealing with. And that day I had to collect and feedback to upper management on a regular basis. So as I say real baptism of fire, but give me a basic grounding and how to deal with Kenneth. You know, it seems full of people when it came to um managing and leading teams in in a more specific in a lab based way, I was able to approach this much more thoughtfully. Um so in advance of, of finding out that I was going to be leading a project team, I was able to take advantage of as many different management related training courses as I could find. So these included things like training courses on the institution specific policies regarding annual leave and sick leave and maternity leave and maternity leave and all those kind of, you know, nitty gritty things as well as more general management courses. So when things like your management style on giving and receiving feedback um as well, the number of courses on project management. So once I was given this this team to lead and I was able to, as I say, to do it much more thoughtfully with much more prepared, I was leading a multidisciplinary team. So biologists, chemists, computational chemists all working together for a single goal. I had to arrange regular meetings to pull all the data together, make sure the project was being led in the right direction, much like my earlier experience, I had to feed back on a regular basis to upper management and I was able to lead our team to a number of key success markers. So these included two publications, one pattern and a successful partnering with a pharma company. When it came to partner with the farmer company, I had to do a lot of preparatory work for all the due diligence and the legal paperwork that had to go through. So I had to really understand it, deep down details of that project and the way I did that was by interacting with all the different team members and getting them to bring everything together. I really think um I have a very kind of positive affirmative management style. I want to give everybody in my team every opportunity to first success. I want to be approachable so that when there are problems I know about them faster and that we can kind of start to mitigate them. I also like to give them plenty of room, I don't want to micromanage. So for example, I'll initially start up with my direct reports of having monthly meetings, just a winter one check in and see how things are going, make sure everything's going okay. And if I start to feel that there are any issues, I'll move up that frequency for monthly to fortnightly or even to weekly if that check in is going to be more beneficial more frequently. Um I like to have a very light touch. I'm not prescriptive particularly on how things are being done until it becomes a point where it's not happening the way I would like it to. I also like to make sure I got very clear expectations for my team, so we have very clear goals, these are set down in gant charts are updated on a monthly basis at our meeting.

Um Whilst I was store manager for a year I was constantly in the top 10% of store manager store managers in my region. Um and because of this I was then promoted very quickly to area manager where I then became responsible for three stores. So during my time as an area manager I ran three busy stores in the northwest of England where I was responsible for all aspects of store management including um hr um finance. And again in this role I thrived. I worked really well under pressure and I constantly met targets and exceeded them.

I trained as a teacher um and again um due to my strong interpersonal skills with the students, I was then promoted to um subject lead across a cluster of three different schools, where I worked with teachers across three different schools to share best practice um and different pedagogical theories.

So um I worked for the state of Washington for a while and then I retired early and then I rehabilitated mobile homes for about three years, 3 or four years. And so I have experience um I bought a fixer upper mobile homes and I lived in it and then I hired a handyman to help me with projects. Today I couldn't do by myself And normally I would pay about 15,000 for a mobile home and then I sold it for about 35,000 And the last mobile home I bought for 13,000 and I sold it for 60,000 and I had you know upgraded the windows in the bathroom and the kitchen and I spent a lot of money on it and so I have experienced hiring people and at the juvenile prison I used to help train staff, especially female staff, it was an all male juvenile prison and I had worked in mental health and special ed. And when I got the job at the juvenile prison I had a lot to learn about gangs and um I had worked with kids with oppositional defiant disorder. So but I really had a lot to learn about working with kids where all their behavior is concentrated in one area, it's like they fight to be the alpha male. So I have experience working in that kind of environment where you know I was working with difficult people and I had a really good um supervisor and a really good program manager and they would help me whatever you know what any of the staff needed help with. They would help us as long as we were, you know trying our best and they knew we were trying our best and you know we made a lot of mistakes and the kids would get over on us, sometimes they would play tricks on us. And um and our supervisors always had our backs and that really helped my confidence. And then the residents the juveniles, they knew they couldn't get away with things because they knew the supervisors were backing us up. And so in that kind of environment it's I know how important it is to back up people who I supervise. And of course I'm good with managing money. I'm good with um managing um you know keeping my eye on Um things that are going on because I was a security officer for over 10 years. So I know how to pay attention and observe and right incident reports. And I worked with juveniles who saw psychiatrists and so I would make notes so that the psychiatrist could read the notes and see how the resident had been behaving. You know had they been out of their room helping other, you know juveniles in the you know with cleaning or were they withdrawn? Were they feeling suicidal? Um how are they feeling on their meds? You know, were they having a bad reaction to their meds? And I um I have a lot of experience doing all of that and I feel like coaching and mentoring is worth so much and um including everybody in the group and taking everybody's um suggestions and input is really important because that helps build cohesion. And that's probably the biggest thing I've learned is that, you know, if I make rolls and then don't listen to what anybody else has to say, they're not going to try their best, they're going to say, oh well, you know, why am I here?

I'm grateful for the time and I'm grateful for um the opportunity. So for that I thank you very much. Um I just wanted to go over a few different highlights of my ability as a manager and how I like to lead firm or leader department. Um So I start with my four main strengths. The first is my attention to detail. I'm very pedantic, very persnickety. A lot of things to be just right and just say it's important, especially in this line of work that everything is thoroughly researched and there are there are no possibilities of error. Um So I like to make sure that we have good templates, good working documents. I like to be sure that staff are well trained also that we can have that key attention to detail things that might trip us up in the future when all of a sudden done. The second part of my leadership qualities I think are that I'm target driven. I'm efficient, I'm focused, I go into a job, I go into a situation with um targets on my mind fees on my mind how we can efficiently complete work within the realm of fixed fee. And I think it's vital to ensure that those targets, those efficiencies are drilled down to the people beneath me. Everybody knows their part in the hierarchy. They know what they have to do to achieve. Um We may compensate people for this for extra work, working harder. But it's important that all members of staff know exactly what we're expecting and it's what targets were anticipating hitting. I very much like to work at the numbers game, but encourage staff accordingly, you know? Um The next, the next item, number three of my four real strength is a community spirit. I like to foster an environment of fun environment, one where we all know each other. We work together, You spend as much time with your work colleagues as you do with your family on some occasions. And I think it's really important that we all gel that there's a culture here that we really want to encourage, which to me is really important to have the right culture. We need to be making sure we've got the right people who have the right goals and ambitions also know how to have a laugh, how to enjoy themselves, how to make work much more fun. Um and I like to try and do that. I like to organize monthly gatherings, monthly socials, quarterly events. Um I like to try and avoid that sort of hierarchical manager senior. Um So they administrator type thing. We like to be one, there's obviously gotta be guidance and there's got to be a bus, but at the same time we've got to keep Um I like level even playing field so that any member of staff knows that they can come to me and we can chat. I know about their cat and I know about their husbands and I know about their 14 kids for example. Um And then my final highlight is that I really drive for fairness equality and justness. You put work in, you get stuff out. I am sort of um unashamed, unashamedly meritocracy will um I like it where we all try really hard and we get paid accordingly or we get extra days holiday accordingly or we get other incentives and I like that to trickle down. Um not just for managers, not just the senior members of staff, but also for um members of our team who are at the bottom of the rank, the administrators, the juniors, the graduates. Um So yeah, overall my four strength as I see them, my attention to detail my efficiencies and the way I like to drive targets and focus, but also my community spirit and my fairness and equality. I am sometimes known as the one man trade union. We all have our weaknesses of course and mine, it can be that I am perfectionist. I have incredibly high standards for myself which I then put onto other individuals, not always effectively. And it's something I'm working on and I'm looking at closely because sometimes I can't achieve my own high standards. So how I expect others to achieve my, my high standards is laughable at times, but it's something I'm working on.

Um at the moment I work um for a university where I am a postdoctoral researcher and a lot of my time is spent supervising PhD students. Um So we kind of have to lead them through their PhD projects. Um So this kind of involves um not really telling them what to do so much, but kind of working together with them to help them choose um appropriate topic to research. Um So a lot of the time I'm kind of trying to direct them Um towards a topic that is likely to be of interest for four years um and it's likely to lead to results that they can publish in academic journals. And so I'm kind of leading them through their um PhD project. My other leadership comes from, I am the leader of research group in my department, so our department is split into four individual research groups. Um and I am the leader of a group of around 12 different people. Um So this at the moment it involves us meeting um every two weeks kind of informally and we um we each kind of talk about our individual research projects um but then I will um kind of delegate specific tasks um to each person within the research cluster or make suggestions for how they can make um more progress with their work. Um So for example, at the moment we're working on a big project together where we want to run a big online experiment trying to understand um the ways in which um different language users kind of differ in the words that they used to refer to certain objects. So for example, like in english you can call something, you can say like sofa and couch and to refer to the same object. And we are As a group of 12, we are planning to run this big online experiment where we're hoping to test thousands of participants to help us understand um what affects which name people actually use. So although we're all working on individual areas of this project, I'm responsible for um kind of leading the project and making sure that we make progress. Um so I have to delegate different tasks to people, so for example, we have one kind of subset of the cluster is working on um selecting pictures for the experiment. So it's just going to be a picture naming experiment where we have pictures with pictures of objects with different names and I've kind of told one group that they need to select pictures for the experiment, we also have another group who is working on making sure that the instructions can be understood by many different language users. So we have another team of people who are responsible for translating the instructions and we also have another team of people who are actually responsible for marketing the studies, so for example, trying to get it to trend on twitter, we're trying to get it to appear in ads on facebook um and things like Buzzfeed and things like that. So I have leadership skills from um this group because I'm basically kind of managing um the different tasks that they had to have to do and making sure that um they're progressing steadily so we can get this big study up and running and to collect as much data as we possibly can.",NEUTRAL,0.2424,0.0359,0.4977,0.224,581.0,MED,7,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),6.46,1,0,0,"Doctorate or professional degree (e.g. MD, DDS, PhD)",Female,8.964762,9.28204,8.875995

I have been a club president of the Engineers without Borders at my school which is very something I'm very proud of because I am not an engineer, but I was still elected to be president of the club because they recognized my ability to communicate with people additionally to my communication skills. I am very educated in the world of HR I have taken upwards of eight classes all high level and I scored really well in all of them. I've done a fantastic job with making sure that I understand management styles, communication styles, personality tests, all the things like that to make sure that I know how teams get along and what kinds of people need to be communicated with in a different way as well as working through several simulations where uh we had to address people in their preferred communication style and intuitively figure it out as the interview slash um, meeting went on. I was also, I scored very high in those, I thought they were very fun. It's definitely part of my skill set.

There are several fundamental skills that you are needed as a manager. There are three really important ones. These are getting along with other people. Being reliable and dependable, dependable and being willing to learn new skills. So in terms of getting on well with people, I have really good communication skills. I'm able to communicate with those from various different backgrounds and maybe to make small talk with, leading that into harder discussions as and where needed means I can make great relationships with new work colleagues really quickly. This then allows a open dialogue between us. So as we are working we can resolve any issues or any conflicts as they arrive. Um there's also been really importance of being reliable and dependable. So I am always in work early. I am always in work. I don't call in sick, I don't just skip work and make sure I'm there. I also ensure that the work gets done when it needs to get done. So for example, if the deadline is set then you can guarantee that the work will be completed by that deadline. Um and it is important to ensure that the quality is also that so I pride myself on having high quality work. I'm making sure that I have proofread it several times that I have made sure that it covers all the aims and it means that the objectives that are needed and also that it's suitable for the clients that we are presenting to. Um and this can change depending on who were, whether we're talking in a informal meeting or whether it's a more formal board meeting and I'm able to distinguish between the two and make sure that my presentations are appropriate for um each case, I'm also able to work well as part of a team and I value the team's opinions and thoughts and feelings on each project. Um It is very much a collaborative approach and not a top of the heavy approach this way I find I get more out of people and they're more willing to contribute and they're more willing to share their ideas because they are genuinely heard, and sometimes it may be that they've had a better way of doing things and that will be acknowledged. Um and you know, and that will then be incorporated incorporated into the work that we're doing. Um It's also really important to acknowledge to superiors that the work has been a collaborative effort and if so and so contributed and that's that's how we change the direction that is included. Another important part of being a manager is being able to conflict a resolute and manage and this is being able to deal with small conflicts before they become major problems for the company. Um So in the first instance, it would be having a discussion with the employee and working out what our concerns were, um why they've got an issue whether it's with myself or whether it's with another colleague and seeing if we can work it out, sometimes it's a clash of personalities, sometimes it can be perceived work that hasn't been acknowledge just being somebody else's.

We can then involve a third party mediator to make sure that the um processes being fair um and we talked through any issues and see what resolutions we can come to together.

My name is Mishka and I am interested in applying for the managing position as posted by your fellow company. The reason why I believe that I am the best candidate for the job is due to my expertise in the auditing field. Firstly I have worked as a senior auditor for the past five years for KPMG. During these five years I have collected a variety of experience, managing skills, leadership and most importantly auditing skills. Under my management I have taken control of junior auditors, trainee accountants and even internal auditors. Internal auditing has been a great part of my experience. Although external auditing also contribute to my experience. Nanogen joanie auditors has been my responsibility solely in compromise with the companies that have been our clients for more than two years. Some of the major companies that have been my clients have been cecil checkers and Apple. It has been a great pleasure working with such I would like to put out there. They're choosing me as a candidate for the managing position as advertised. Would never be a mistake as I am a devoted hardworking and skilled individual if not by words. My past achievements show this or rather prove it academically. I have excelled from my matriculation until my undergraduate degree and my honors which continued into my masters field. I am qualified in accounting and I have passed both my board exams specifically the initial test of competence exam and the A. P. C. Which is the second board exam. All passed on the first attempt. Therefore I can confidently say that I am a committed, hardworking qualified chartered accountant, selecting me as part of representation for your company would be the best move and the smartest move that you could make during the years that I served with my previous company. I had taken auditing accuracy results to the next level From a percentage of 75 Accuracy had been taken to an astounding 90%. The only reason why I had chosen to leave the location that I had previously worked for. It's due to the fact that I feel that I as an individual need more exposure to greater industries. I now would like to lend out my hand to industries that are working with chemicals fuel and simply a different kind of an environment which would then expand my managerial accounting and financial management qualification. I have already practiced auditing, financial accounting and taxation. Although my venture to managerial accounting seems to be an exciting road ahead that I cannot wait. Be part of kindly review my CV and my cover letter and choose me to be the candidate that you can trust and confiding and bless your confidence in. I assure you that I would never ever let your company down. I believe in myself. I just need you to believe in me. If you have any questions or queries, please feel free to contact me. I have also indicated the references that I have been associated associated with in my previous work experience.

Most of them have come to me from a very junior position and worked their way up and give them as much ability as possible to prove themselves on a regular basis. I'd like to think I'm a very empathetic manager and that I encourage my team too. Progress as much as possible. I think that's shown in the fact that most of my team has stayed with me four At least 10 years. The ones who have left has gone on too much higher and better things within the organization or external to the organization. When I first came to this position, the team was very fragmented. There weren't any process in place. And there was a need for further training which I have provided over the years. We often get requests from other areas within the organization for people to come and do. This continent's within the team. Because we have such a good reputation. We try to encourage these requests as we think it's important to remember that the organization understand what we do. We can understand what we need in order to function in the way that we need to function. I think it's now time for me to move on. As I've already proved myself and take on a larger role. Mm hmm.

I've already proved myself to the conversation and I've been commended repeatedly over the theory that I've already been in my existing role. Um I think the fact that I have being recommended previously for promotions shows the organizational values highly. Over the last few years, I've also taken on additional responsibilities across the organization and stepped up into more strategic positions repeatedly on some very large projects. For example, recently lead on the project of land acquisition and created a joint venture for the universe for the organization which had been done in a very timely vast manner and then putting together various functions within the organization to work together to work out what the what the organization needed strategically, we all did this work very well together.

I believe I'm the best candidate for this leadership role because I have very clear leadership style, I I have a clear plan which I like to stick to and I have a good overview of what's going on within my team and the wider environment at all times. Mhm. If I was to get this leadership role, the first thing I would do would be a skills audit in order to find out what the strength of my team. I think good leadership comes from knowing who you have working with you. So I would do a skills audit and have a good view of the team that I'm currently working with and that way I can see if there's any gaps in beautiful link or any strengths that I can use to the team strength. I like to play to people's strengths. So if there are positions that need to be delegated or jobs that need to be delegated, then I would certainly look to doing that. I've worked in teams before, where the leader, the leader takes on absolutely everything to the detriment of the team. So I don't think that that works. There's some things you need to be top down about other signs, you do need to work as a team. But with that leader taking the ultimate responsibility, I am very much firm, but I am an approachable person. So within my team, I do feel and I know that people can come and speak to me with any issues that they may be encountering at the time knowing that either they can speak to me in confidence or that I can resolve any problems that might arise. I'm a good listener and I think that you need to be particularly in the area of education that I work with him because you're working with multiple people in stressful environments and they need to be heard. And the problems need to be taken seriously. Talking of which I am a good problem solver. I have often been able to see through to the root of a problem and found a very simple solution to make everybody's lives easier. This generally comes down to just being a particularly well organized person. Um uh specifically organizing I. T. And resources on I. T. That can be then used to our strengths rather than having a whole load of a mess. Um Which is no use to anybody where people spend all their precious time searching the things and can't find them. You need to have a clear route through um for the job that needs to be done. And so that does start with having this clear plan and a clear sort of skeleton if you like. That can be built upon. Mm hmm. I think ultimately a good leader is somebody that can listen to others and can take ideas from others as well. I think you must be considerate of other people within your team because everybody has their own things going on. So you need to be able to keep a cool calm head when maybe other people are getting stressed about particular situations. Um I think I would be the right candidate for this leadership role because I I'm very organized. I have a good way of seeing the whole picture. I will always play to the team's strengths. I have the capacity to understand person's strengths and a person's weakness and therefore play towards them. I would enjoy delegating tasks to others that wanted to take them one and that would find them enjoyable and therefore spread out the workload among the team, making everybody's lives easier and hopefully also making their jobs more fun and more enjoyable so that we can retain staff in this particular environment. I think that is especially important given that we are hemorrhaging staff and two, uh well struggling to recruit new members. So keeping the team happy is very important.

I also believe that I'm I thought I knew the industry very, very well. I've been in this field for a long time and I have made sure to educate myself. I've done a lot of training outside of working hours in order to be able to communicate successfully to clientele and two members of the press as well. I have also built very strong relations with members of the press. I've built strong relations with journalists, publishers and I believe that I can pass that on to the team of people that I am able to lead. I have had managerial roles previously to this, this particular job, There was a time that I was a barista and in certain areas of work when you have agency staff coming on, it's very difficult for them to get the ropes really quickly as they're moved from company to company and then move from location to location. So the knowledge that they have isn't very cemented, there is also a tendency for the managers too, let them Get one with it essentially knowing this and knowing that I was a member of staff that needed the support needed the help from these agency staff, I did take it upon myself to educate them so that they knew exactly what they were doing, so that they were confident in what they were doing because when you're doing retail work like that and hospitality like studies available very stressful, especially during rush hours. So I tried to understand the strengths of each member of the team. Making coffees can be quite a complicated process. So in the quiet times I ensured that I taught them how to do the more difficult things and in the busier times I allowed them to do the easier things like manning the tills as well as restocking the drinks and restocking the shelves of cutlery straws and things like that. So I I ensured that they knew exactly what they were doing and when things did pick up a little bit and got a lot busier. I would then slowly introduce them to the idea of doing the more difficult tasks and towards that of the week. They were really thankful for my help for my guidance and my patients with them. I believe that as a manager, I will be able to offer that in this area of work, offer my patients offer my guidance and help the team be successful and feel rewarded in the tasks that they are able to accomplish.

I'm very good at analyzing things and understanding what needs to be done when it needs to be done and understanding the strengths of the people that I'm surrounded by.

Thank you for considering me for the role of manager within the retail establishment. This is my video. To explain why I think that I am perfect for the role and why I think that you should give me the go ahead to do the job. First of all, I've had many years experience in the retail sector over 30 is where I started out and it's where I stayed. I have a thorough working knowledge of how the retail trade works and have worked in many, many different environments from Skincare, through to clothing. And it's been a wonderful journey for me because at the heart of everything its people and its people that make that business work, whether it's the cleaner right through to the ceo communication is key and as a manager that is your absolute priority. I'm very holistic and people centered and that's what gives me my strengths. I'm a good listener. I have actually trained within the counseling framework and I am used to listening and hearing what people are actually saying to me and valuing it. I'm good at keeping eye contact. I watch body language. All of these things are very important, not just with my staff, but also with the customers on the shop floor because when people feel respected and heard they actually will return and they will actually spread the word that things are going well and staff are the same. You want to retain staff, you don't want a high turnover and if they feel that they are listened to then that is a huge bonus. Everybody has different strengths. I'm very good at coaching, so that I can see where somebody can improve upon already existing strengths and play down their weaknesses. I do think that positivity with people is a really key objective because they will grow, they will learn trust and they will come to you and actually be the best that they can be within that sector, It doesn't matter what the job they're doing is, everybody is worthy of respect and of being the best that they can be within their job. I'm very good at listening to the words people use, so if they talk with the words see a lot, I know they're very visual for example, and I can work with that to reflect that back to them in my communication, which builds trust and that is what is really important, People need to trust their managers and to know that they can go to them. I also value family life, I believe in work life balance for people. I think that quite often, nowadays there has been a bit of a an imbalance for people and if they are happy in work and know that work values their home life and is interested in them as a whole person, they are more likely to perform well within the framework of their job and that to me is vital. I do believe that this job is very much about people and that's where I am very, very strong. I'm also very respectful of others. I believe that everybody is equal to me and that I am just there as a catalyst in order to help them to succeed, very smart in my presentation, I do believe that you have to give a good example that you need to look good and that that does actually help people to respect you, but not in a power way, in a way that makes you approachable, but also respected and very, very keen on team, I think that people working together empowers them and it's very important that people are rewarded and very hot on rewarding and also rewarding teamwork. So, I'm really keen to be able to bring people together to work on shared goals, whether that's within the environment that we're in, or whether we go out and actually do team building or social activities, that actually help people to know one another better and therefore work together better. Because actually your establishment is only as good as the communication that exists between the people within it and to be able to see how people are together and to encourage them to communicate more clearly, actually means that you have a much happier working environment. So, that is my submission for the job and manager. I am very people centered and very experienced and very fair minded and very kind and I'm very hardworking. I don't believe that you should ask anybody to do anything that you're not prepared to do yourself and I model that every time that I am in work so that people can see that I am just like they are and that we are working together to be successful.

So firstly I have worked as an applied practitioner for 11 years and as such, I've actually worked as part of several multidisciplinary teams. Now when working as part of a multidisciplinary team, you're often working with individuals who come from an entirely different ethos and background to yourself and as such, I'm often working with people who have a different idea or angle with which they are addressing the particular issue for the client. However, I have learned how to approach other people in such a way as to maximize upon all of our capabilities. So my interpersonal skills have become quite strong. So for example, a number of years ago I was working with an occupational therapist and they had a very negative interpretation of my particular field. So I actually sat down with them and outlined what were their expectations for me, what would they actually like to have done? And we worked on that together and I was able to dispel an awful lot of misconceptions around the field that I work in and we were able to establish actually a very positive working relationship from there. Um I often, as I am the individual who's working most closely with the client, I have a tendency to take on all of the briefs surrounding their quality of care and I worked very hard to advocate for the peop that I work with. So as a result my communication skills have gotten quite strong but I have learned to advocate without being belligerent. Um This is quite a fine line because you want to ensure that you are advocating with strength so as to be taken seriously but not so strongly that you are seen as being unreasonable or belligerent. So I think that I've I've quite traversed that line quite well. Um I obviously have a very extensive amount of experience within the field and I have conducted a number of research studies studies with within the field including a number of articles which have been published considering um the most evidence based practice around care and not only do I use this within with my clients, but I also use strategies like this when managing aspects of my team. So I am a b c b a D. So that means um that I am a doctor really based behavior analyst. So I'm often in charge of individuals who are in the pursuit of certification and in order to do that, I have to ensure that there is a very clear outline of expectations of a more supervisory role and a supervisory role. And so I often sit down with my supervisors and outline what is expected from them and what is expected from me because I find that having a very clearly outlined bi directional relationship, we end up having the best possible results. So again I have a certain amount of experience from even my B. C. B A. D. Experience when working within a managerial position. Um I have also lectured on a number of modules and again being in charge of that leadership based role has come not quite naturally to me but it's something that I have learned extensively over time and I have learned to be quite good in terms of my communication abilities. Um Then in addition to that I have um quite a number of personal attributes that makes me quite ideal for the role. So for example I'm a very good listener. Um I have been described as being incredibly empathetic. Um it is not uncommon for people that I work with to actually approach me to ask my advice or to just simply confined something in me that they would wish to get off of their chest. And I'm often able to speak with people to help to come up with some sort of a solution to their problem because often people come to me for example I had a student come to me recently and they were so overwhelmed with the amount of work that they had and they were talking about leaving the program that they were on. So I sat down with them and we problem solve together and we basically figured out what it was that was impacting her immediately and we came up with quite a person centered solution to address that and thankfully we put that into place and a couple of weeks later, she is still in the program and is actually fed back to me that she is much more happy within the current role.

Um If they had any complex or contentious cases to deal with, which was often the case, I would oversee them and even take them on if if that became necessary. Um I was the department lead on things like geographical information systems and database matters um on recruitment and selection of new staff for the team. Um I would be the one who would be leading on any sort of law or protocol matters for the team and the other people within the team and within the council as a whole would come to if they needed any advice on those matters. Um I was responsible for leading on the liaison with other groups of government departments centrally and locally um and with county councilors, but also chair formal and informal meetings for the whole team and as necessary. I would deputize for more senior managers as well that did become necessary for quite some time when the team leader became unwell and was then subsequently unable to attend to work, became the interim manager of the whole department for sometimes um stepping up to the next level of leadership management. Um Some of the skills I have obviously learned on the job, whereas some I have learned through being on a course or training sessions, so I've devotes skills with um dealing with difficult people through my role and through training courses, whether that's dealing with difficult people on the phone or in person. Um And to assist with that, I have had training in personal safety including weapons awareness, I've been trained fully in recruitment and selection to make sure that I stay on the right side of the law, especially in terms of equality regulations. Um I've been trained in managing finances and resources and managing a budget effectively. Um I have skills that I've learned through new management training. So at the council, Any new manager has to undergo 12 weeks of quite intensive new management training, so that covers all aspects of management and leadership training, commissioning and outsourcing is a skill that I've developed and something I have been trained in and which is something that all councils in England really took on in terms of outsourcing and commissioning services to, you know, save money and provide a better service. Um And one of the other things I think is very important to mention is about proactive performance, management, getting the best out of the team through proactively managing their performance, nipping any thing in the bud that um, could grow into a bigger problem. So the old biff acronym of of when you need to talk to the member of stuff about either something in their work performance or their behavior that isn't acceptable. You know, you describe that behavior or what it is about their work that's not suitable or acceptable. You talk about the impact that's having on people and on the team's work, um and performance and look at what you would like them to do in the future.

So in this video I'd like to talk to you about my experience in managerial positions, um the qualities that I feel that I can bring um to the role to make the role of success and um some previous achievements that I've been able to make in my current role and my previous role. So I have held a managerial position for the last 10 years in various organizations and you'll see that part of my application and in the last four years um in my current role, I have been promoted to senior manager. Now I feel that in my career so far I've been able to really gain and strengthen and hold down some key leadership skills that I believe has been really beneficial to my career and generally the success of my team now being a strong leader for me is being able to work collaboratively with my team. I I'm a strong believer that you are as strong as your weakest link. So as a team, I am really take time to understand each person's and skills and what they can bring to the team and what knowledge they have to help make that team one that works together in achieving key objectives. So what I would do if recruited into this role is to do that, first of all, um I may come with some ideas and I may come with some thoughts, but I do know that the best way to work with the team is to listen to the team. So and during that I would then form some key objectives and devise a plan to best achieve those objectives. Now I believe that my strong decision making skills is what keeps keeps the team on track, we form a plan, meet those objectives, we can touch base and I do like to do that regularly, making sure that we are, where we are in the plan, whether or not the plan might need tweaking whether or not actual resources might be brought in, but in doing so, if we able to have that clean plan and to um check in with each other, that is how I feel is the best way to work. Now, I've been able to do that really well in my current position and previous positions in that we've been able to form different streams of income now, in my current position as a senior manager working directly below a board of directors. I understand the dynamics of that relationship of guiding how the company would like things to be, but also be guided by the board of directors and how they would like the company to be and what we've been able to achieve in the last year through our different streams of income uh um tangible results. And for my board of directors there's nothing more tangible than more money And being able in the last year to increase our income by 22% is my best achievement.

My name is Larry and I'm going to speak about my key leadership abilities which I think may be perfect for this role. I've undertaken a lot of work experience over the last five years including working at some big firms in teams producing some amazing results. So for example a couple years ago I worked at PWC and we worked on a team to come with a new innovative idea which we then had to pitch and those Given the winner to the best one that allowed me to work as a team. I also managed to volunteer myself to be team leader and so I let the team trust coming second out of all of the teams. Furthermore. Over the years I have taken part in network wherever I can at school and at university which requires leadership as new people join the team, you need to make them feel welcome and also working as a team and ensuring things like time management. Um And furthermore in the previous summer undertook four weeks of experience in data consulting who I was working with another person. So that required teamwork that in order to produce results from these large quantities of data um and then communicating back and forth with my manager. So that was really good experience for increasing both my own personal responsibilities as well as working as a team. Um I really want this job and I am willing to do whatever is required of me and develop whatever skills are undeveloped in order to gap the position. I am also really good at numbers for my data consulting too. My work in my degree in psychology, working with statistics and therefore that is a strength of mine which I I would be happy to um bring to the team. I'm also extremely responsible and have really good time management which has allowed me over the years to do successfully well in both my jesus is and A levels and now has and has landed me the job that I am in at the moment, I can provide references for my level of skills in that department. Also, my degree at the moment is um essay based degree and therefore my writing abilities are really good as well. Okay that in terms of my communication skills over the years, through reaching out to people and communication, I have managed to achieved these high level work experiences. However, I also do a lot of work within hospitality, this has allowed me to learn good communication between client and customer as along with working as a team in order to produce results quickly, especially on days which are slightly more busy than others. With my communication, I found also along with working person in hospitality, working in firms where I've done like my large proportion of mobile experience, I've had to do presentations and a lot of producing kind of slides and standing up in front of clients in order to present this information which I think is a really key skill that is required and I think it makes me the perfect match for this job. As I said before, I'm extremely flexible, I would start whenever, but I hope you can see that my leadership qualities, along with my general abilities within this work environment make me the perfect candidate for this role, along with the fact that I'm willing to learn new skills and develop as much as possible.",POSITIVE,0.8317,0.0009,0.1671,0.0002,585.0,HIGH,16,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),5.51,1,0,0,"Some college, no degree",Female,8.849,9.167249,8.846381

Um So firstly, as you'll see from my Cv, I have had various roles over the last few years that have definitely enabled me to develop my leadership skills. Um I in the last three years I have participated what worked in a study that a research study that has um had 350 participants between myself and another colleague. We co managed the entire cohort, which meant that I was very much in charge of a large majority of those participants completely independently. Um I had to completely independently manage my time in terms of when I spoke to them how best to to help them, a lot of the times I had to make executive decisions that were um often regarding vulnerable situations and vulnerable people. Um there wasn't always someone from a a higher up qualification or senior senior leadership team who was there to advise me. Um and so that was really down to me to make executive decisions, and that was something that I really enjoyed taking responsibility for my work and um feeling confident and learning to feel confident in the decisions that I've made. Um secondly, I, last time I took on a role which allowed me to manage three undergraduate students independently, So this was a summer program that they took part in over 12 weeks and I independently managed all three of their time. Um so both in terms of was leading them through their work, but also leading them from a pastoral point of view um at various points of their study, giving them advice, speaking to them on a on a kind of personal professional level, and this is something that I really enjoyed, this isn't something that I had experienced before before this, I had felt a little bit worried in terms of how to strike the best balance between being an authoritative leader um and being um friendly and connecting with the people and forming um professional relationships with them. And that's definitely something that I think I've got a lot better and a lot more confident at, and I would attribute that to that process. Finally, in terms of my experience, I'm currently and have been for the last six months, the board representative for my institute across the faculties. So this really has allowed me to come into my own in terms of leadership skills, both in terms of having conversations and focus groups with my peers and with my colleagues, and then being the person that's in charge of collating all of that information, all of those views, um and taking that on to higher up management and senior leadership team, and this has been really interesting, both in terms of specifically learning how the architecture and the structure of the leadership team within an institution works. Um but also allowing me to find my place and where I fit within that and how my views and my skills can really make a difference and have an impact on the way in which these types of institutions have run. Um So it was really interesting to see both from a kind of um leadership within my my colleague and my peer group role, but then also working with higher up management teams, which is always something that you're going to encounter in any job role, whether that's um a leadership role or not, you're always answering to someone higher up. Um secondly, I took part in some self initiated training um so this has involved a project on connecting with industry and also an independent consulting project and the most, the most personal thing that I learned from both of these training courses was the ability to be resilient and confident in your own work, I learned how to manage my own time, how to pitch a design, pitch my own ideas, I'm really being kind of confident and resilient in the way that I pitched this. So I learned to communicate my ideas to a range of different um stakeholders, industry partners etcetera, and obviously being able to communicate with many different stakeholders is really important in leadership in itself, but also this really having this confidence and to basically back yourself in terms of even if you get knocked back at different stages um and to be that person that will take on that responsibility again, it's something that I really enjoyed and something that I was, I was really surprised that I I did enjoy and I flourished so well and um just quickly in terms of hobbies and qualities, um I would like to say that I'm a very resilient person in general. I'm happy to stand up and make decisions for the group whilst also making sure that everyone's voices ahead. And I think that's a really important skill, Amanda balance to strike with leadership. And I think this, this job at this time would would be um a really good progression for me and allow myself to to flourish in that regard further.",POSITIVE,0.9655,0.002,0.0301,0.0024,887.0,MED,9,99.0,2.0,Using only (2),9.400001,1,0,0,"Bachelor's degree (e.g. BA, BS)",Female,8.457553,8.783325,8.840772

Um and you know, I had like nine hours of class every single day, no sleep all work, but I just couldn't focus, I couldn't focus for a plethora of reasons, one being the and the fact that, but then my parents were going through a very, very tough time, they were struggling with homelessness, they were just, they couldn't pay the bills, they were like everything was going wrong with them, right? And simultaneously, you know, then obviously I'm paying myself through school and there's just this big looming number, I think it was $40, um of debt, right? That was just being held over my head, not to mention my parents that, right? So I just couldn't focus on my studies day in day out, I was seeing all these kids who didn't have these issues um you know, they were just grinding day in and day out, unfocused right on their studies because they didn't have external factors impacting their studies. So early, early 2019, I made a pact with myself, I made a New Year's resolution two, do something about it, and that's something in hindsight. It was, you know, Mhm, A bit small. My my goal was to make $500 For the entire year of 2019, that was the goal, and I know that sounds obscene, but at that point in my life, I figured, you know, you have to start somewhere and if you don't do anything about it, it's just gonna grow bigger and bigger, right? So you have to tackle it from one perspective or another. So I remember at that point I started out by just like having an Ebay account and I sold a couple of very, very old electronics sitting in my room And that within two weeks that amounted to $500. I think it amounted to more, I think it was 700. So then I was like, hey listen, I'm going to double it because clearly I, my original goal was to lower, right, let's do 1500. But you know, at that point it didn't have any more electronics to sell. So I think during that time it was like during my one hour breaks, I would go to the shops downtown and I would find like these little trinkets and then I resold them online for like a small profit. And my goal originally was Like let's make $5. That quickly happened within the week. And then it was okay, let's make $10, let's make $20 and then it doubled and it doubled and it kept doubling. And I think leadership is all about just like it begins with taking ownership over your own life, right? That's that's where it begins and once you take care of yourself very well you are then able to start figuring out, hey how can I then use this, use this knowledge, use this managing ability, use this ability to talk to other people etcetera etcetera to help the lives of others. So, You know, with the small business that it grew, I was then able to you know, tackle my $40,000 pretty quickly and then I turned my head and was like, hey let's tackle my parents, you know, the situation and I helped them through that. And to this day that's where leaders, the definition of leadership has gotten me. But it's still evolving, it's still like what more can I do? How much more can I make this interaction more beneficial to everybody? How can I make this sound better to the other member? So they don't feel burdened or they don't feel, you know sad because it's also about human relations, right? It's not just about tackling issues, it's about building a very grounded relationships.

I am currently somebody who is not formally employed, but I juggle a lot of different responsibilities as a home educator, organizing my own Children's education, but also contributing to the home education community By arranging events, regular events and one off events. Um formally I have been a teacher and had a leadership position within a school throughout my life. I've I've had roles within the church in arranging events, in coordinating teams of people and ensuring that an outcome varying outcomes can be achieved effectively. So my, the skills that I have that enabled me to do to do these roles um have focused not only in my own particular abilities as a problem solver, somebody who's able to take in a wide range of facts quickly and marshall them into some kind of an order and reposition them in a framework so that we have a step by step process to go to, to reach an end goal. That's a personal ability I have, but I don't believe that's the right way or the best way to achieve an outcome. And especially as a leader, it's important to have everybody on board and bring everyone along with you. So I have focused very much on developing my listening skills and making sure that I understand what the whole team can contribute and wants to contribute and knitting that together into a way that we can work together using everybody's strengths and allowing for people's weaknesses, giving them opportunities to strengthen in areas where they need to be strengthened, but to excel in the areas where we really need them to excel. So my listening skills have been honed through working with Children of a range of ages, and also working in groups within the church overseas, at home, groups of older people, groups of adults, groups of young people, and I think having experience of a wide range of people, wide range of abilities, of backgrounds and attitudes has really enabled me to be flexible in my thinking and has meant that I have understood the importance of being absolutely focused on the outcome that is necessary and building the team around that outcome. So, um part of what I've always done is making sure that the plans that we have to take account of a big picture, so we have a direction for the whole activity that is being led at that time. And I think in in doing that, I'm able to provide a real focus for whatever that team effort is. But I also find that I am very interested in the in the details, the small things that actually build a really good quality framework for going forward. So, for example, um walking through the details of an event, the timing being precise about timings, about quantities, about the atmosphere, whether every word and action that we are doing to achieve, the final goal is focused in the way we want it to be.

I'm a highly motivated and organized political economy graduate with a passion for managing and I have a lot of experience in music and radio broadcasting. My career aspirations are to work in the radio industry and I'm really excited to bring the skills that I've honed in communication management and leadership to this management role. The bulk of my professional experience has been working as a general manager to the University of puget Sound's radio station k ups As a manager. I was responsible for the day to day management of the station, including managing a team of 16 core staff members Managing the radio stations finances with a budget of $3,000 per semester, ensuring daily on air broadcasting runs smoothly and solving whatever problems arose. The radio station was completely student run. So most of the responsibilities fell on me as the student manager and I really took pride in how creative and driven the whole team was during my year as the general manager, the administration eliminated the operations advisor who was the only real adult working at the station. So I really had to take on a professional management role and do the best that I could to keep everything running smoothly. I taught myself how to fix and work all the equipment in the booth While keeping together the team of 16 and 200 DJs. I'm really committed to managing the station and keeping everything running smoothly and I enjoyed learning how to manage in the process. Before that, I also worked as a hip hop director and alternative music director. So I got some management experience in those roles as well. I hired and mentored over 50 DJs, completed air checks to ensure that the shows were running smoothly, communicated with artists and promotion companies to set up in studio performances among other tasks. I had to manage 50 DJs, which meant a lot of communication emails back and forth, holding meetings and generally being there for the entire staff of DJs. Um I just loved being able to, you know, bring my background from the music director position into the management position and I think I really thrived. I'm really driven. I am very organized and I really value team based projects in coordinating activities to achieve a common goal though, I do consider myself a natural born leader and I think that I would do great in any management position. I had some problems come up in communicating with the staff and learning how to manage a team. It can be really difficult at times to trust your own judgment and realize that as the manager, everything really falls on you at the end of the day, you can lean on your team and you can assign tasks to other people, but you have to trust yourself and your own judgment as best as you can. I'm generally a very confident person. So this wasn't very difficult for me and I believe that that would translate well into any management role. In addition, I don't have any issues sharing the workload and putting responsibilities on my staff, which I think makes for a really good manager because I don't get too overwhelmed and I don't think that everything is up to me. Part of being a manager is being able to rely on your employees and your teammates. And that's something that I'm very comfortable doing. So.

I like to be the person um that others come to. I'm extremely um enthusiastic about um the vision for the team and not only that, but helping people learn new skills, meet new people and just get excited about their careers. I want them to want to come to work in the morning, I want them to bring their creative ideas and their energy and positivity and I really foster that um In the department, I am very organized, which I think greatly helps in any sort of management really. Because whether you're managing to people or 15 people, you need to be organized, you need to know what's going on in the department, who's doing what, who might needs something who needs more challenges. And then not only that, but to be able to review people, um not necessarily even formally, but to give feedback and positivity, they did this really well, or praise them for something, maybe they tried or stepped outside of their comfort zone, which is very difficult for some people. Um I'm also very good at tailoring my management style to individuals. So um some people like direct feedback and that's great, I can give direct feedback other people, they need sort of a roundabout sort of feedback, more of what if you had done this or what if this happens, rather than, you know, you could have done this. So tailoring the management style or communication style, I should say to each individual person is a strong suit of mine also, because everybody's different, everybody works different. Everybody thinks differently. And I think that's really important, um depending on decisions that need to be made, some our final answers, some I make the decision and that's the way it's going to be, but that does not mean that I don't welcome feedback. Everybody's opinion is worthy and um most likely will be considered, but it doesn't mean that's the end result. The end result is my decision and as a manager and a leader, you have to take ownership of that if it works out well than fantastic. If it doesn't, you have to take ownership of that and said, I could have made a better decision. This didn't work out as I thought, and another strong suit that I could bring to your team is that I take feedback very well. So if someone thinks, you know, this decision isn't very good, I'm not sure why you you did that. Why do you say that? I don't get defensive. I don't say, well you're wrong. Um I might ultimately believe them to be wrong or that their idea won't work, but that doesn't mean I don't listen and it doesn't mean I don't encourage um that sort of discussion in the back and forth because people like to feel that they're being heard, um and that they are worthy and an important part of a team and that doesn't necessarily mean they're idea has to be implemented. Sometimes the value comes from saying, I value your opinion, let me think about it. I'm not sure that's going to be the best course of action, but I appreciate your contribution and and sometimes that goes a long, long way in making people not only just satisfied with their job, but enthusiastic to keep bringing the ideas and the creativity um into the workplace. And, you know, I think those are my strengths as a as a manager. I'm organized, I listen to people, I tailor my communication style to individuals, and I really try to foster a team environment in which everybody feels comfortable and there's a shared energy and positivity um in the day, because it just makes the workplace so much better um for everyone.",POSITIVE,0.9767,0.0006,0.0212,0.0015,665.0,HIGH,14,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),20.29,1,0,0,"Bachelor's degree (e.g. BA, BS)",Female,12.54403,12.83337,12.55495

Her And I'm applying for the manager position um in terms of leadership qualities and abilities. I'm somebody who has kind of sought out leadership positions throughout my adult life, um both volunteer and paid. So I've been the internal coordinator of my psychology course union um during university. I am now a volunteer coordinator um as well as somebody who has a lot of public speaking as an education facilitator. Um and in my spare time, I am volunteering for the Pride Society here in the city um where I'm the actually the vice president, which is a new position for me. So somebody who's really um gone after these leadership positions um and has skills um that I've built over the years. So in my education facilitator role, I give workshops and lead group discussions on topics like sexual health and inclusivity, which I think is really important in any leadership role. Um but also just the ability to manage a diverse group of people through discussion, coming to conclusions and making sure that everybody gets a chance to speak is one of my um most salient abilities in leadership. It's a really great communication skills. Um and my volunteer coordinator role, I have to manage a group of volunteers. Um part of this also includes hiring and training new volunteers. One of the things I really focus on is training because I need to make sure that everyone's really prepared for the job that they're doing um and making sure that they feel comfortable. So I always offer the volunteers that I manage um debriefs after their shifts. Um other resources that they can access if they feel uncomfortable if something happened that made them stressed out. If they don't know who to go to, they can also go to um the union or executive director. So, always giving those options to people and making sure that I also get feedback um and evaluations as a leader and as a volunteer coordinator to make sure that I'm just doing the best that I can. And I really take the feedback from the volunteers that I hire. Um very seriously. So in addition to those kinds of skills being communication skills, managing a team training, I also really focus on diversity, inclusion and equity. So making sure that if certain voices aren't in the room that we seek other points of view, um that we're seeking the right points of view and my role here at this non profit. Um part of it works is working with people who are using substances. So making sure that when we're making policy um and talking to other organizations that we have people with lived experience of substance use in the room. Um and that we also people with lived experience on our board, um and making some of those big decisions. Um so getting a diversity of opinions in that and also making sure that we have resources that reflect diversity and inclusion for our staff and clients. Another thing that I've done within this, that it wasn't as part of a leadership role, but shows I think a lot of initiative and leadership qualities is my ability to start new initiatives and be able to plan those from start to finish. So finding funding for those initiatives, doing ground writing for them, figuring out who's going to volunteer for those, um how they're going to be run whole plan um budgets and things like that. So really all aspects of planning those new initiatives in this have been very creative, have to do a lot of creative problem solving, which I think is a great quality for any leader um in this field. So for those reasons I think I'd be a really great candidate for a manager position. I have demonstrated my uh skills throughout the years. And if you take a look at my letters of reference, you will notice that they are glowing. Um and I can also send you some of the evaluations from my workshops if you would like.

I believe that my experience in my life and my past career experiences have given me the skills required to be an excellent leader and mainly I think this experience comes from a career in teaching. When you are teaching a classroom of students then you must have a very assertive presence or else you'll lose your students very quickly. Um I've been a teacher for over 10 years and and there's a certain presence required when you walk into a classroom these days in order to just command the attention of the room. I don't really believe when I'm talking about leadership that this is something where you boss people around. I don't really believe that that makes a good leader. I think that a good leader is someone who those around them wish to follow one to follow because they respect them. Um they admire them because they trust them. So these are the qualities that I believe that I have that would enable me to be a good manager um for this job position that I'm applying for. So other than 10 plus years in teaching. I've also had a lot of different life experiences. I've lived abroad. I've lived in Arizona in the USA and I've lived in Thailand and I've traveled extensively and this allows me to be and basically able to speak to anyone and to communicate well with anyone and to listen to people and acknowledge people without judgment. So for that reason I think that I would be an excellent manager because I can sit down and have a conversation with someone where they feel heard and accepted and I think this is really important. Like I said, I don't really believe that leadership is about just bossing people around, but about gaining the trust of the people that you're managing and that way they want to, they want to follow you, they want to allow you to be there their manager and help them in their day to day tasks. So yes, I think I can sit down and have a conversation with just about anyone where they'll feel um acknowledged, important, understood and that there, you know, the life and the their experience is important and valued. Um really I think that whether I've been teaching students or in various supervisor roles that I've had in my life, I never really feel that I'm above anyone in any way. I think I treat people with respect and equality and kindness and compassion and in that respect and their trust and then really they want to, they follow you, they want to allow you to and manage them too, organize their day to day tasks and supervise them because they trust you and respect you. So yes, I think this life experience and career experience has really enabled me to to take on that leadership role by having an assertive presence by understanding people and connecting with people and being very, very approachable and easy to talk to, I think that that that really is a sort of the third thing that I'd like to talk about is I've been a professional athlete for most of my life and have been part of so many different teams, whether it be sports teams or um teams within my career workplace. And I think this is like actually, possibly the most important part of being a leader is being a good team player and understanding the and really crucial and parts that each person within your team plays, not just the manager, not just the leader or the supervisor, but every single person is seen as valued and important and with a particular role to play and with that respect. Um without taking into account each person within the team that you're managing is doing their role is participating to the best of their ability and that way the whole team um in the workplace is progressing together. So that is my, my interview and I hope you enjoyed it.

So I like to plan out what everyone's going to do and delegate jobs, especially finding people who could do the job the best. So I've been doing that um, even when I was little and I was one of the best in my class most of the time. So a lot of the time the teachers asked me to lead groups or help other students and do like little tutorial groups. I've been a tutor since I was young, especially in mass, um, and would help other people that way and kind of organize it every time we had group activities, I would always kind of take the initiative, take the lead organized, who was doing what makes sure people were on time and checking. I've been supervising students for many years now, um and just letting them know what to do, making sure they get their work done, making sure that their projects that they end up doing uh good enough and what they can use for their CV because it's important for me that the entire groups as well, that the entire group contributes, but also the make sure that those people who are not doing it to the best of their abilities can do it that way and contribute the most that they can to the activity, all the personality tests I've done previously, a voice said I should be in a managerial position because of these abilities because I'm not particularly emotional, very rational. Um I don't get into arguments, I don't get loud, I just calmly sit down very logical and analytical. I know what needs to be done. I know how to delegate. I'm a perfectionist and that I want it done the best, but I also know when I'm not the best person for the job, but other people are, so it's a lot easier for me to delegate jobs and not have to do everything myself because I'm not one of those people who needs to do everything at my own. Um other than that, I've been part of, I was of course representative in my graduate degree and undergraduate degree, so I represented the people and what their opinions were, so I'm very good at listening and making sure that everyone's voice is heard and um what what needs to be done is done. Um here I'm part of a group that organizes um new students and helps them out. And I usually lead projects like creating the website or how we introduce new students buddy systems so that the new students get good um support when they arrive here. I am not afraid of tasks. I'm very social. I'm outspoken, so I don't mind saying what needs to be done. I'm not shy at all. I really enjoy leading because I feel like once you have the success and a team effort works out really well, then that's worth it and it's way bigger than if you do it yourself. I don't mind sharing responsibilities but I also don't mind sharing the prize or like the recognition at the end. So people who contribute, they will get their recognition for what they've done. And I think that's super important because sometimes group leaders will always take the entire credit and that's not fair. Um Other than that I just generally slip into leadership positions whenever my managers have not been around or on vacation, I'm always the individual that's been asked to lead the group take over and I usually do jobs that are above what I'm supposed to be doing. My old position. I pretty much led the entire lab even though I was also just a PhD student because our professor was busy being a medical doctor and so I've had experience in working with finances and working with organizational billing with ordering and things. So a lot, a lot more experience than I should have at the position that I'm at and yeah I'm very reliable. I'm always on time. I don't lose track of things I'm organized. So all the tasks that need to be done are usually done and everything is set and it's usually in a way that you can find all the documents, everything's filed away properly and just done with a high degree of precision which is probably one of my best abilities, my organizational ability. Yeah. Um I even enjoy being a manager. I I like to work with other people. I like to work in groups. I like to help people learn to be confident in their abilities and go from being a team member to maybe also being a manager at some point by teaching them how to think for themselves and get work done and organize themselves and just giving them the confidence that they need that they're able to do things on their own. I'm pretty good at seeing other people's potentials. Um So I know what they'll be good at, what they won't be good at, so I don't usually assign people jobs that I don't think they can.",POSITIVE,0.7027,0.0082,0.2856,0.0035,892.0,HIGH,12,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),16.83,1,0,0,"Master's degree (e.g. MA, MS, MEd)",Female,8.71449,9.038104,8.730262

So I'm jen and I am naturally a leader. Everybody seems to come to me for advice and how to handle situations. I'm a really great listener. I'm always keep an open mind about every single situation. I also feel like I am very empathetic and that I won't ask anyone to do anything that they are not comfortable doing, nor do I ask anybody to do something that I wouldn't do myself. So for instance, if I tell them, please go, you know, clean out the parking lot, I better make sure that I know how to clean that parking lot to just so that I can say, you know what I've been there, I've done it. You just need to get it done. We can all work together and you know, dream dreams make the make the teamwork right? Teamwork makes the dream work. I always say teams make the dreams. So the other thing is that, um, I also try to defuse really stressful situations with humor. I feel that most of the time humor can really diffuse the situation. It can help with. Um you know, just really bringing people back down to a level playing field. Sometimes emotions get really high and you just need to de stress the situation. The toughest part about any job is, you know, rude people don't understand and it's really, really hard to not take offense to some of that stuff and it's not personal and you just need to defuse the situation. So I use humor a lot of times. Um, I also lead by example. I said very, very high standards for myself and I will sit there and go the extra mile and be held accountable for that. I believe firmly in getting everybody. You know, if it says in the rule book, you know, not to fraternize with certain departments, guess what? I'm not fraternizing with certain departments. Um and the thing is is that we're looked upon differently than other people in society because we are in law enforcement so we need to make sure that we are setting the standards for other things. You know, especially when we are held in such high esteem. We can't go around and be drunk at a bar, start bar fights, that's not going to happen. So you, you know, I feel like I'm held to a higher standard because one I am a manager and then too because I'm a leader three is because we're in law enforcement. So it has to be that way. The other thing is that I come to and then leadership role with great listening. I know I've touched on it a little bit, but I'm always here to listen to all of my coworkers, my subordinates issues and problems, even their day to day stuff. Everybody has a personal life that's outside of the work and we need to take time and recognize that we also need to recognize that everybody has a bad date and sometimes you react to a situation that's not in the greatest thing. Let's listen, let's try to improve. How can we stop people from having a bad day at home from bringing that to work? And I think that's not addressed enough on how people, you might have a personal problem at home. How do you stop bringing it to work? And so I try to address everything with that because we've all been there. We have all had a situation where we were like, you know what, I just had a really horrible day. I don't want to be here and then something you are. I always try to let everybody that I know my direct reports that my office door is always open for them. They know that I care that I'm going to listen and I'm going to offer suggestions. You don't have to take them, especially if it's just about your personal life.

My name is Christine Edwards. So you very kindly invited me today to come and talk to you about the position where I will be managing people. Um I have previously managed teams in the past. The largest team that I managed was 67 people. How I managed the team was by making certain that everybody was very clear what their responsibilities and their targets were having clearly defined roles and responsibilities and understanding what my expectations were. I managed this through weekly meetings with team leaders and then want ones with my directly direct team leaders once a month. I believe in having a clear and honest conversation. And tough love is a really important part of managing people and well I've always had an open door policy and would like people to know that they can come and talk to me at any point. I also like them to know that I'd rather know about things that have got wrong because if I know about them early enough I can manage them and potentially mitigate. Um I quite like the concept of tough love love. Iii being really straight and honest with people. Um not everybody is comfortable with that, but I think that it is a much more honest approach to managing people. What else can I say? I believe very strongly in making mistakes because actually making mistakes is a way that you actually learn from things that you've done. If you haven't made mistakes that's probably met means that you haven't been trying hard enough and I haven't learned how to do things in a new way. I guess I would be more challenging on people if they continue to make the repeated same mistake, time and time again mistakes are good, but only if you learn from them and say that you're never going to get caught like that again. Um I've managed a broad range of people both from an ethnicity perspective and from an academic perspective and had people reporting into me that were um may be thought of as being not so good in other roles that they've had. Um I was very lucky that my team was seen as an area where people came and learned jobs, learned tasks and learned some critical skills. Um What else can I say about it? I think that's enough.

I believe my leadership style is, is a democrat but I allow people who work under me to be able to like feel like they're part of the team. I believe their opinions matter in everything that we do in the business because as a manager I am sitting on top and I don't do the day to day things. So it is important for me to beat black when there's a decision to be made that affects the employees to involve them, for them to have a clear understanding of what it's like the company is about. I involved them in those steps and so that so that each and every decision that we do, they will feel like they are part of the team in each and every achievement that we make so that they know that they are part of that achievement in failures so that people can have a sense of accountability because now if you were there when the decision was made and something goes wrong, now when we want accountability, people of black people feel like they are allowed to speak as to what happened without fearing of binge is fired because because their boss is a dictator is true, this is what happens if this doesn't happen. No, I don't believe in that a lot of my abilities is I think I'm a I'm a good communicator and I'm able to to keep my emotions in check when I'm dealing with employees, when someone has done something wrong, I am able to deal with them specifically not attacking the actual person but like I wanted to find out what exactly went down the actual problem, not attacking the person who has done of the wrong thing.

What actually makes me a good manager, like all the best candidate for the job would be my experience in the management position and also the empathy that I have for employees but also being business minded and understanding that as much as the employees are important but the business comes first, that means that is to say mhm KPI s must be met objectives must be met. And I also as a person, I'm a person who would like make sure that on a personal capacity as a manager, I admit my KPI s so that my supporter needs to be able to meet their should I appear incompetent in any way to my support needs that will give them room also to also be incompetent and and I think that it's something that is like it's okay to be incompetent, it's okay to just come out and whatever. And I also believe in teamwork, I encourage teamwork that I think that's one thing that makes me a good candidate because I would encourage teamwork in in under that work under me because I believe two heads are better than one.

I managed a team of 25 people and within a school I have led smaller teams but had a lot of responsibility. The skills that I've learned with in both jobs have been able to use across um both jobs because leadership skills are interchangeable and things I've learned and the bank also applied within the education world and also within normal everyday life As I said, within my 1st 10 years of my career, working for a bank, leading a team, working up, working from the bottom of the organization up to leading a team of 25 people using various leadership skills, such as managing meetings, running diaries, dealing with appraisals, dealing with underperformance, motivating a team, working on targets and target setting, as well as strategic development with a senior leaders leadership scheme within the education system. I have been a leader for a year group, so monitoring targets of what Children are expected to get, as well as planning a curriculum that needs to be delivered over a yearly basis. Within that. I've also worked with colleagues who have needed to be supported within their work as they were underperforming as well as motivating some to strive for higher levels. As I said, the skills I've learned have been in have been interchangeable, such as coaching. Once you have learned the skills to be a coach, they can be applied to any situation. Um and now not only coaching with adults but also coaching Children um for skills such as facilitating meetings, I can do with an adult level and I'm also doing it constantly in the classroom, facilitating different groups and inspiring Children to be the best they can be. So there are, management's a leadership is a skill you can learn um many, many books on this subject, many training courses, many exams that you can do, but also I feel initially part of you because if you don't believe in them, then they're not going to use those skills well and you're not going to be able to pass them on to others, that is your goal. You want to make sure that other people can use the skills that you have gained. So a leadership is not for everybody, not everybody wants to be a leader. Some people are happy to be led and to follow other people feel their leaders but really aren't very good leaders takes and some some aspects of leadership are difficult, especially when you're dealing with underperforming people or with an appraisal situations because it can be very hard to have those difficult conversations with members of your staff, especially if they feel that they are doing well within the education setting. Leadership, not only involves looking at what is happening on a day to day basis and being prepared for outside inspectors come in such as offset, but it's also the strategic development of the subject, how you think it should be led, how you know, changes are due to be implemented and it's a strategic planning of those in education that can be quite lonely as often you are the only leader in your area where whereas in other industries there are often other managers, leaders in a similar department to you that you can work with. But education is quite on your own. So um you need to be motivated to use the skills that you have to share with others. So leadership has said can be learned, but I think most people more are natural leaders than learned leaders.

Um As I just um I'm going to talk to you about my leadership skills and why I think I am the best candidate for the position in management. So firstly as a qualified speech and language therapist, um Communication. Um I have really excellent communication skills and I'm very good at working within a team and also um independently.

Um So looking at each each member's strength and using those to promote best practice. Um I'm in I'm innovative and I like to be creative in my work, I like to find new ways of doing things. Um For example, I'm currently trialing a new way of working that will reduce waiting lists for families. Um So that has been very successful and we are now looking at leading on rolling that out within other areas of the company. I believe that I am motivating when I've been working with colleagues. They have commented that I um bring a positive um positivity to to the workplace. Um um I believe in ongoing team development. Um looking at ways of strengthening our team relationships between each other and also looking at new um um Any opportunities for us to develop as a team, for example, I have organized training for the whole team to take place next month, which will be part of the whole team development. Um say these are lots of skills that I believe I have, that means that I will be a good manager, um my communication skills especially as a qualified speech and language therapist. Um I am able to change my communication depending on the individual that I'm communicating with and the situation that we are in and when I need to be, I can be um assertive, I have had additional training in conflict resolution um but also I can be approached and very approachable and I've been told that I'm an approachable member of the team so that people know that they can come to me for support when required. Um I'm continually looking for ways to further develop the team that I work in and I can empathize with with team members when I need to um and also motivate them to carry on their good work that they are doing.

I think I am capable of being a manager and I do have a managing space because I love working with people and I love exploring what other people think about the kind of job that I'm doing. And I like to hear ideas and options of people that I work with. And one other thing I am very much patient working with people. I like to hear what other people think and if someone is not performing it, I had to work for example, I'll call that person and set him or her down and try to get the root of why he or she is not doing his job or performing. And a particular job that is given. And one other thing when you're working with people as a manager, you must encourage them, whenever you give them a task, you must be a manager that you encourage your stuff to work to do their work to the best of their abilities. And you must also set an example. You must be a manager that works and does everything according to the rules. You you have you do not have to deviate from what you are and what you are supposed to do. You must delegate the work according to the ranks of your stuff And also to your work. And also do a follow up on every work that you delegate. Mm hmm. And everything that you are doing at work that involves your Because you're cold. Because you must be able to talk to them whenever you have a conflict with them. There are stuff that are not getting along. you must be able to sit them down and try to understand what it's going on. What is the problem then? If you can solve them, if you can solve them and if you can help then it's good and whenever they get involved in conflict they must leave their conflict out of their jobs and responsibilities. And the other thing is yes and the other thing as a manager you have to be able to work with people of different rates in different cultures and you must understand that as people differ. So in every situation that you dealt with you must know that you are dealing with different people, different beliefs. You must always accommodate each of your employees. So as a manager you have to be responsible. You have to be accountable of everything that involves your organization. And as a manager you have to be a leader. You have to be a leader I insist and being a leader and having the abilities of being a leader, you must have your strength as though you will have your witness but your strength must be above your weaknesses. You must always ensure transparency when you're working with your people of the organization that you're working off and as a manager you have to lead and exactly and as a manager you have to send and people told with everything that you encounter and as a manager you have to love people, you have to be accommodating and as a manager you must be lenient to others. And I think that's probably it. That's probably I think I've covered most of the things but as a manager you are you must know that you're working with people and you're dealing with people so you must have the heart and the patient and you must understand different things and different beliefs, different cultures, you must have your strength, you must be accommodating and you must be responsible very responsible.

It was with a very small company, we only had about 10 people. But because we were so small I had a wider variety of duties I think that I would have at a larger company. We were basically we did research and development to come up with new diagnostic tests for the veterinary industry and once we came up with the product idea and made sure that it worked correctly, we manufactured diagnostic test kits. So the first step is research and development. And I had to go over the the research results with the employees to um see what they found when they did the experiment and to decide what the next step would be, what would be the next experiment they should do. Um And then eventually uh to help decide with the president whether this test was going to be a good fit for the industry. Would it served its purpose, Does it work well? And should we produce that diagnostic test kit? Um The company we had, like I said it was very small but we were a USDA approved facility. So when your USDA approved facility you have to follow very strict guidelines, they you have to submit um in detail what you're product is going to be and every step that you will take to make that product and when you do the manufacturing, you can't deviate from what you've what they have approved. You have to follow it very strictly. So I had to make sure all the employees did the the manufacturing correctly and that everybody followed the proper steps. Uh There was standard operating procedure and um when when the product was ready um It was very important to have good inventory control. So I was also in judgment and Corey control and making sure that everything was in the proper place in the cold room so that you wouldn't accidentally picked the wrong test off the shelf. When the product was ordered it has to be had to be very organized. Um Because the worst thing you can do is send a throat product. The second worst thing you can do is not have the product available when somebody places the order. So I would say inventory control was one of the most important parts of my job. Another aspect of the job was um the U. S. D. A. Would do inspections of our lab but they don't tell you when they're coming they just show up whenever they want to. So everybody uh me and everybody else we had to be prepared to just to answer every question they had when they walked into the door to show them every step we took to show our uh procedures and that we follow the procedures and um that every step was valid. Uh We had to do very special testing on every lot number and keep uh certain test gets back and and show where we had those be able to like locate those very quickly if the inspector asked. And um uh just to be able to show every every detail of what we have done. Um The the final thing is when we would get a big order it would take everybody to put all those test test kits together because we didn't have the kind of storage that we needed in order to have the cats put together and put in storage in a cold room. They had to be in uh Packets and then we would assemble it at the last moment. So if we got a big order, everybody had to work together as quickly as possible and make sure the product was put together accurately and sent out and the invoices sent out and make sure people paid us.

So the first way was when I was volunteering for the student run society Nightline. This is a society in which we would take calls, respond to emails and respond to text messages from primarily students who were struggling with various different issues, so from anxiety to depression to even things such as suicide. Um so we took some really tough calls and made a big difference to people's lives. Um and once I became a proficient listening volunteer, I decided to take the role and as an individual who would train up new volunteers. And so this involved me organizing and running a 2.5 hour session once a week for six weeks. Um and I trained up 10 new volunteers. Um and so I did this alongside one other individual and we would have to run these sessions which would involve teaching these new volunteers some key concepts that they may come across and also teaching them the skills that they would need in order to become a proficient volunteer themselves. Um and within these sessions I had to organize role plays and I had to act within those role plays as well. And this was quite difficult because the 2.5 session is a long time and keeping individuals engaged for that amount of time can be really tough. So we had to kind of make sure that the sessions were interactive, they were fun, they were engaging and also make sure to schedule regular breaks. I also felt like as myself, I had to become come across as confident, I had to come across as a good listener, I had to be kind and empathetic and I also had to make sure that I was approachable because when you're training to do something like this, it's quite a big responsibility. And so these individuals had lots of questions about the content and also about the whole situation and about the act of doing this job volunteering opportunity. So I felt as though within this opportunity of providing of being a good leader, I also developed a number of other important skills and I also had to make sure I could involve everyone in the session because some people are naturally quieter than others. And so I did have to kind of really act as a bit of a teacher and a good leader in that sense, to kind of encourage people in a polite way to speak up and to contribute as well. Now, the second instance in which I really developed my leadership skills was during my volunteering. Um as part of the student run society charity Fab stock. Now, this was a society in which we would take a young young Children and adolescents out with learning disabilities would take martin days out and as part of this, I often had to be part of organizing activities for us to do and I took quite a strong role in this start and I would have to organize fun things. And this was being a leader within a different group within with students, not students, sorry, with people with a variety of different learning disabilities. Um and so this could be really challenging at times. Uh some of them couldn't even speak, some of them had real difficulties with their speech. Um others have just very severe behavioral issues and so being a leader in this situation was really tough and it meant I had to be adaptable. Um had to be really flexible with my work. You couldn't plan an activity be rigid with it because you couldn't necessarily guarantee how the session was gonna run because a lot of these Children obviously they have different issues, but also they were very unpredictable and so one day they might be okay, but the next day would be really struggling. Um So that was another way in which I really developed my leadership skills because I had to really be confident in delivering these sessions and confident that I could adapt my way of thinking and my way of running a session. Um and I had to be really clear and again, really compassionate and empathetic and I had to really be able to be approachable to these young um individuals who some of them really didn't have much confidence. So that's why I think personally that I would be a good candidate for this job because I think I'm a really strong leader and I think I've developed the ability to be a good leader in a variety of different situations.",POSITIVE,0.5901,0.0052,0.4004,0.0044,784.0,MED,8,99.0,2.0,Using only (2),11.35,1,0,0,"Master's degree (e.g. MA, MS, MEd)",Female,8.176731,8.511214,9.191763

So I currently, at my last job, I currently work at Cold Stone. I love those part time position. I learned a lot and I spent most of my time there throughout the summer because of Covid. So in that time I learned a lot about being a manager. Of course Marceau an assistant manager, but I took a leadership role when the actual manager wasn't there because they're really one on duty. So while I was there I learned to be a key holder and a shift leader and then turn that man. I would uh so my hours let me open the store but also close the story sometimes both in one day and so in the morning it was me opening a store and making sure everything was in order. And then I would get someone to help me out throughout the day to make sure the stores all set up in such and throughout the time I would the other time I would tell the other person like what task needs to be done next. And if they had any question they would ask me. And if there's any customers disputes, they would ask me for any assistance just in case it was a little too much for any of the other workers to like handle and such. Um throughout the day it was usually me taking on some of the harder task or just test that I would know from my experience rather than the other people who haven't worked this long and I was also had the role of being a teacher essentially, but part of, in that role, it's also like my responsibility in case I taught them something wrong or they interpreted something I said wrong because I didn't explain it in a way that was mostly clear for them to understand or it could be easily misinterpreted. So for my and another and part of like the closing shift side of it all, it was um basically effectively getting our team out in a decent amount of time so we can all just go home because at the store I worked were all students um at my store there was um prepare our students. It was usually we all had a really good grasp of when we wanted to get out and we had a decent drive for getting out and I knew I was a leader, you have to like make sure your team isn't, you have to balance being super serious and make sure things get done with, also making sure you're still friendly and people want to actually talk to you and respect you. So keeping that boundary of being respected while also making sure that they know that you're still a friend and you're still like someone they can talk to just in case anything happens or even just so they're comfortable talking to you in case of any employee disputes rather than customer disputes because those can be hard to handle and I made sure that I was, I made myself someone easy to talk to you in case they had any troubles with that. And also as a leader you have to be prepared to, as I said earlier, the responsibilities of any mistakes that workers make from something that you said because in turn it indirectly was your fault because you gave out that misinformation or they just interpret it from you wrong. Even if they interpreted for me wrong. In the end, you're going to have to figure it out because you are the leader in that sense. At least when I was there, I was the leader in that sense. And so making sure like I commonly resolved any issues or making sure that nothing was in disarray or in a panic state while trying to resolve such issues definitely was, I would say a plus in um working there, especially learning that as well, That's skill for my manager and oh no, I think those qualities will make me a great person for this position.

Um I've held many positions over the years that involve teamwork and over that period of time I've gained a lot of experience on um how to work with people what their moods are and how they get along together. Um Another reason would be how close attention to detail I have on projects that I undertake. Um Working as an auditor for a long time, about five years now has made me very aware of very small details in the work that me and my teammates complete. Yeah. Um my relations with other coworkers has always been friendly and professional throughout my whole career, I enjoy getting to know people that I work with and I like building bonds with my coworkers. It often leads to great success within the company. It really shows when people get along and are doing their best together. Um It helps everyone, including me, them, the team in general, our customers, everyone's really happy in the end, when everybody gets along that way, um I respond to concerns whether they are an email or in person in a very timely manner. I am very familiar with working in these spaces that often involve tight deadlines and require immediate responses. I'm very fast to get back to anyone no matter if it's a big issue or if it's a small issue um I will get back to them, whether it's like I said, an email or in person or through another method, um I won't just leave someone kind of hanging with no answer. Yes. Um Now, if a team member is ever concerned about not reaching a deadline or if they feel that um they have too much on their plate at the moment. I'm more than happy to step in and help when I'm able to. As long as I'm there, I will be there for anyone who needs me. I'm very good at prioritizing what needs to be done as soon as possible. And I'm able to tell the difference on, you know, what needs to be done right away and what tasks can maybe be on the sidelines just for a little while longer while we tend to those more important tasks that need to get done as soon as we can do them. So I'm fairly good at sifting through those. My attendance has always been well above average. I will always let my superiors know if there is a time that I won't be in the office or if I'm going on vacation, they will let I will let them know uh far ahead in advance. I don't want to put any surprises on my teammates or management if I'm not going to be there. Uh they'll always know. I always clock in on time at the appropriate time of day. Whenever I say I'm going to be there, I'll be there, like being there with people, you know. Um and I'm not afraid to take the lead when it comes to arranging meetings, presenting new information in front of a team. Um I have a fairly good leadership skills in that regard to I also have a lot of experience training new hires, showing them the ropes. If they have any questions or if they need anything from me, I can handle questions from many people at one time. I can sift through all that. I'm very used to dividing my time appropriately in that kind of way. Yes.

First things I feel late. Leaders. The leadership rule is made for specific people. For me for people to see new and challenging opportunities as a way to learn from them instead of seeing them as a chore. That needs to be done to invest more on an outstanding job in doing this sort of team. It's the best abilities of doing the bare minimum and will constantly try to improve rather than just my a master of every leadership skill personally. I feel right. I want my team to have a great impact. I want to broaden the empanada limited him. I want him to have high performing. You have reported all the tax in the new. Much more than a single person can and I want them to work together as a whole set of just a community of people working individually. I want my teammates, I want to be a leader that can make my teammates find all their needs and specific desires. And if one teammate has a weakness, I want my team to be able to step in and fill it instead of just leaving that one teammate to go out on their own. Mm hmm. I also feel like leaders have more opportunities to build skills within their team organization. I feel like as a leader, I could bring new skills to the table. We could grow faster and we could create new opportunities to learn different things and I could learn from my fellow co workers as much as teach them some things by listening to them at the coast. Um I meant it. I feel like if I do this, my team and me can both grow as an organization also as a leader. I feel like you have to be interested in watching your co workers grow because some leaders, they're only focused on the so but I want to see not just me but everyone around me grow as a whole. I want to see the interest is my team work and my co workers are having and see what they can do to improve themselves. I feel like I feel like a leader also has a great desire for an environment which improve the environment. I feel like I should not only be the one that's writing other final team. Yes, I should have a say I shot a big scene but he ended the day Iowa my team and me to come to a conclusion as a whole instead of me just decided for the team. So we're all on a good note examples of what I've been a good leader. It was back in high school, I'm stinking was Grade 11. I was the leader of the student council and leader of the student council, you have to make sure everyone's on task, Everyone's doing their jobs right? Everyone knows what to do. and even though I myself am not the one who's doing the work that the specific other rules have to do like the treasurer representative, I have to make sure that everyone is doing their part to make the student council run smoothly. I'm good as a whole and I did that, and that's why, in my opinion, I'm the best fit for your leadership role.

I believe there there are a number of identifiable qualities or traits that can be found in good leaders, but I'd really like to touch on perhaps the two or three most important to me, but I feel that I can bring to the table and really differentiate myself as a candidate. The first of these traits involves effectively planning and course has it. This requires an ability to see the forest from the trees and establish objectives that relate to the broader good the organization. This may involve liaising directly with upper management, listening to the objectives that they may wish to set and taking those on board and transforming those in a way that you can communicate to your t. And whilst I am a very detailed oriented person, I'm also able to step back and see the bigger picture and importantly decompose this broader objective, all set of instructions that I might have been given into a series of smaller manageable tasks. This ensures that any team that I will be managing might be managing, is working in harmony and working towards the same shared goal as the organization. 2nd of these traits is good communication, so the community, so communicating these plans and goals to your team in an effective manner, Which really means two things to me first, the ability to articulate your thoughts in a clear and concise way that is easy for everyone to understand as well as to be motivated by. But also ensuring that you as a team member or team leader are accessible and maintain an open line of communication such that if any issues do arise, your colleagues or your team members will be encouraged to share their problems with you. No, I've always told my teams in the past, but problems and generally identifying problems, it's good. It's not only inspires an opportunity to improve, but they also inspire creativity. And finally, the 3rd point of or the 3rd trait of a good leader, the ability to understand everyone's strengths and weaknesses such that you can delegate tasks according to this by delegating and handing over responsibility effectively, you not only increase the probability that the tomb would perform to its highest standard as a unit does ensure that everyone stays motivated and is genuinely engaged in what they're working on or doing. And in general studies have shown this makes for better performance overall. So to summarize good planning and goal setting, good communication and a good understanding of everyone's strengths and weaknesses. These are the areas where I believe I can differentiate myself as a candidate.

I have two grown up Children, been married for 39 years And I've been in full time employment since her life school at 18. During that time I've had various occupations, the majority of which were spent with Strathclyde police. Um, prior to that, I was in the UK Civil Service where I was an executive officer, had a staff of 10 to manage at that time. And during my 23 years in the civil service attended several management courses have picked up numerous tips and hence along the way special from some of the most senior colleagues I worked with who were very happy to show a young man starting out his career how to deal with and manage staff properly. obviously having been a police officer, which I was for some 30 years I have worked various conditions, uh, various places throughout the west of Scotland, I reached the rank of sergeant and as a result had to attend management courses. Yeah, to facilitate this, this rank. Now, obviously in policing terms, there is no end product other than making sure the public are safe on topic. So, as you can imagine that it was a different level of skill set that I learned when I was in the police and very much having to think on your feet leaning on the more experienced officers there, obviously rank structure. So you would pick the brains of senior officers who had been around the block as it were. I got tips and hints on how to manage and lead staff and what I found to be very, very important and something I've implemented myself during my time as a manager was that don't ask anyone to do anything that you wouldn't do yourself quite straightforward that. And as long as someone acts in good faith back them to the hill, if they're wrong, they're wrong and we'll deal with it all right. If it's in good faith, we try to help our staff. I'd like to say that I have a fair and balanced outlook whilst dealing with people. I have no prejudices, scan a gender race. Religion means nothing in the workplace to me, everyone is equal and I would strive to help anyone, particularly people who want to get on in life. We must help promote them, but also understand that there are people in the workforce who are happy to do their job and happy to provide at the level of the right. They might not have ambition, but they're two to progress in a particular workplace, but their ambition is to be the best they can and to provide the best they can, which I would fully support. Having left the police I retire, I became a safety and facilities officer. I may just voting venue in Scotland And on a Saturday I could have upwards of 300 staff to work with. This was again, providing a a safe and comfortable environment for thousands of Spectators to come and watch professional football Again, I tried to be there for my staff was always visible, always talking, making sure that they could contact me should I be needed? I'm showing that I would muck in, I would help them. I find it vitally important that people understand managers, understand them. We've got to manage the people if they could be having an off day because of domestic problems, money problems. We've got to understand as managers that that can impact on the workplace and try to make their life at work as pleasant as possible, while ensuring that they still can produce and meat targets, but without harassing and bullying.

I have a lot of experience leading teams groups and managing others. So I think I would be a good fit for this position. I have a lot of experience good traits that allow me to be good managerial prospects first and foremost I have co founded and in the current ceo of my own business I lead a team of five people I have to problem solve every single day and I interact with teams, customers, partners, vendors, a lot of different people. So I you know, I lead product development, I lead sales and marketing customer service, so I've learned a lot in the five years doing this in the past have also held other leadership positions. I have co founded groups in high schools and college. I've been the treasurer of Alumni association at my university. I've also been on the alumni association board for my high school. Um I've helped plan prom graduation different things. So I always find myself in leadership positions. Um some of the skills and traits that lead to this and consequently lead to me being a good leader um pun intended is that I am empathetic. I can relate with people of various backgrounds um whether it is age, gender, ethnicity, et cetera. I listened to what they have to say. Um I don't just make decisions unilaterally. I want feedback and buy in from those um shareholders and stakeholders that are going to be impacted by the decision as well as that are going to help me make the right decision. I try not to be the smartest person in the room. Yes, it's good to be smart, but I like to surround myself with people that can teach me different things that I can learn from them and grow because none of us are perfect. And any leader or person who tells you that they are or that their way is always correct to me is not a great leader because you need to be able to recognize your strengths as well as your weaknesses. So that way you can hire complimentary people to mitigate for your weaknesses and and manage the risks associated with those weaknesses. Um, so those, that's really, you know, the empathy and the ability to listen and surround myself with people that are complementary and being aware of my weaknesses are very strong, straight traits of mine. I also am decisive. So when we have to make a decision, I take my time. It's not all impulsive. I gather all the facts. I make sure it's a research based logic decision versus you know, gut reaction or emotionally charged decisions because I find logic tends to logic and reason tend to guide better decision making. Then I'm just going based upon, you know, how you feel or what emotions you have. So that is very important to me. And that's kind of going with the getting stakeholder approval, doing research, you know? Yes, sometimes it takes a little bit longer, but I'd rather make the right decision the first time than you have to go through two or three decisions and you know, correct for mistakes. So that's also very important to me and then I am very independent but collaborative as well. So um I don't micromanage people, I fully delegate when I need to, I'm able to do my task and then you know, pass it off to other people, rely on upon other people. So to me it's it's imperative that my team can also do that because obviously teams inherently work together. But it's also important to have people that trust you and rely upon you. So that way when I'm not micromanaging them, I I trust that they're going to do my work or do their work and that they trust that I'm not going to sit there second guess them micro manage them, look over their shoulder 24 7. so I do give them some freedom, some independence, some leeway and that way I think that allows them to problem solve and learn and grow because if I just tell them what to do then you know, any teenager or intern can do that. Like I want people that help problem solve and and challenge me because as I said, I'm not the smartest person in the room um I like to be challenged. I like to learn. I like to make sure that we're doing the best thing for our employees, our customers, our company, et cetera and you know, that's that's why I think I would excel as a manager and a leader here for this role.

But essentially I've been the captain of successful um football teams. Um I fully understand that teamwork is a big part of that success as well and um and just knowing the different attributes of your team members, how they react under pressure, how to get the best out of them, what their strengths are, what their weaknesses are, how to encourage them and sometimes as well how to talk directly to them in a very straightforward manner. So I believe I can bring that to dis management role as well just to be able to talk to team members to understand whom who they are, how they tick and how to get the best house them in the workplace. In my professional life. I've I've come across individuals from a large cross section of society from from different backgrounds, some from the present country which I live in of us who have immigrated here from other countries. So I've had to learn how to talk to different individuals from different backgrounds. Had to for example I've had to be mindful not to um uh Not too perhaps talk to certain individuals without a male presence because that's frowned upon in their culture. I've had to learn how to uh make sure that in some cultures it's very it's very normal, it's very traditional to physical touching just to show friendship and what have you, but I've had to learn how to steer clear of that with certain individuals that I've come across to respect their culture. I'm a keen listener as well. Um it's obviously it's a very important part of management to be able to listen to your colleagues, to be able to listen to them, take on board what they're saying to a certain extent, did decipher what's important, what's not what would be beneficial for the team and what wouldn't be beneficial for the team. I've got extensive knowledge of that and I believe I can certainly bring that to this leadership role and just my, just, my general nature, my general character in general, I believe is is very, very key to this management position. Um I guess I would describe myself as uh introverted person in a very positive sense though. I think a lot of people when they think about introversion, they perhaps think of it in a negative terms as in as someone who perhaps isn't the fun of the party life and soul of the party, someone who isn't able to engage as a team, but actually the opposite is true. It's actually introverts who are able to listen keenly and carefully to what people around them is saying. It's actually introverts who are able to um taken board, good ideas and because they've taken on board the whole picture, they're able to provide good, clear cut advice because they have considered all options. And another attribute of introversion again, as I mentioned before is being able to listen two individuals who might come to you for assistance for problems um and to provide them with a good answer as well. So those are three main reasons I believe I'll be brilliant for this management position, my character then the nature of my character as a quiet person, but but direct and um force for what I need to be. The attributes which are built up in personal life through my leisure activities, from my past experiences in sport, and attributes which are built up in my professional career as well, um working in a team and engaging with employees. So for those three reasons I know that I am the best fit for this management position. Thank you very much for the opportunity to give my thoughts. I appreciate it.",POSITIVE,0.5157,0.0036,0.4803,0.0003,688.0,LOW,6,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),11.62,0,1,0,"Doctorate or professional degree (e.g. MD, DDS, PhD)",Male,9.086285,8.81354,9.885703

Um I've worked as a machine learning engineer for about three or four years now um over that time I have had the ability um and the opportunity to manage multiple people at multiple different levels. So I've managed people who um either have more education and more experience than I do and people who have less education and less experience than I do. Um I think the best way that I can describe my leadership ability is my ability to learn from both of those types of people. Um I know that I'm going to be managing people of all different skill levels and all different experience levels and education levels in a manager position and I think the number one thing that you need to do as a leader is to learn and to listen to the people that you're managing um I don't think that you can be an effective leader if you're not growing and learning along with the people that you're managing. Um So I always ask myself a few questions before I get into the process of managing somebody and beginning to draw tasks and projects and um you know the day to day life for the person who I'm managing? And I'm asking myself was I ever in their position, was I able to thrive in that position? And if so um how did I thrive, why did I thrive? And if there was a manager when I was in that position, what did that manager do to help me thrive and then how can I emulate that with the person that I'm managing? So um drawing on my personal experience to make the experience of the people um that I'm managing, uh you know have the best manager experience. Um I think the next thing and the one thing that I always like to focus on is the goals of the people that I'm managing, so those could be career goals, that could be life goals, they could be specific technical goals, they could be goals related to the project that we're working on. Um And I never frame that question within any one of those buckets, I always ask them um what are your goals? Um And you know some people will give me um a specific goal of a technical challenge or a project that we're trying to complete. Um But someone give me life goals, someone give me career goals and then what I want to do is I want to convert those goals into action and then uh you know a positive productivity for the company. So can I take the goals that somebody has and turn them into a good thing for the company? Because if they are achieving their goals they're satisfied. But then if we get the productivity that we need and we get the outcome that we need at the company for a project, they've achieved the goals for us as well. Um and I think goals motivate people, I think being a leader, you need to find what motivates the people um that you're managing and you're leading, and if you can find what motivates them then they will produce good results. Um And for me personally this is going back to my own experience, I was always motivated if I was working towards a goal, there were jobs that I was in, where I was working on my goals, but on my own time and not for the company because the project or the work that I was doing was not aligned with my career goals or my technical goals. So basically my leadership abilities are coming from my own experience and my experience with leaders and managers and I know what works well for me, I've been in the ml engineer position for a long time and I know that anybody that I'm managing will also feed off of the same uh good, positive managerial aspects that I'm picking up myself over the last couple of years. Um And then in terms of specific abilities and specific personality traits, I think I'm extremely empathetic, um I'm able to look at somebody's situation and anticipate how they're feeling, anticipate, you know, what they want to get out of a project or a situation and then listen to um what they actually want to get out of the project or how they're feeling about the project or about the work experience, um you know, obviously anticipation is not always going to be perfect, so I need to ask lots of questions and listen completely openly to make sure that what I was anticipating is correct, because if I anticipate wrong that I'm going to um send them off on a project that they're not going to like, and that's not going to be aligned with our goals. So I think my empathy feeds that kind of goal oriented managerial um and leadership ability that I was mentioning before, and I think this is the best way to get our employees motivated and get them to achieve their own goals while achieving goals for the company as well.",POSITIVE,0.6602,0.0139,0.3104,0.0156,879.0,HIGH,11,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),19.32,0,1,0,"Bachelor's degree (e.g. BA, BS)",Male,9.251853,8.973483,8.572958

The reason why I believe I'm the right candidate for this position is because in my five years of experience in managerial positions, I have developed skills and abilities that make me the perfect candidate for this position. I am a person who does things with integrity because I believe that is the most important of all leadership skills, because everything stems from the I know how to be decisive, I know how to delegate. There have been instances where I had to make decisions on the spot and because of the experience that I have, I was able to do that and when I talk about integrity, when you're dealing with people, it is very important for you to escape yourself. And in my experience, I learned that when you do things with integrity, eventually it does work out because even if it doesn't work out, you do know, you know that at least you didn't do you know anything that is criminal or anything that is bad, you know, so it doesn't mess you up as much. And I also believe in leading people in a way where they don't feel like you are bossing them around, but they feel that you care about them. So I care about the people that I work with. So I don't see myself as just somebody who's, you know, on top of people, you know, to to to dictate to them. No, no, no, no, no, no as a manager, I believe in getting the best out of people, you know, that is, that is who I am. You know, not only am I self aware, I'm also aware of the people that work with me, I'm aware of where they fall shot and I'm aware of their excellence as well and I'm able to get, you know, the best out of people, if there's one compliment um that I've gotten over the years is exactly that, you know, that uh oh, you know, thank you for bringing out the best in me, that is who I am, you know, I know how to bring out the best in people and I also do know that I have an ability to, to influence, you know, and I do believe this is very important in any managerial position because you are going to meet people who are very convinced on who have a conviction on their ideas and you need to be able to see those people down and say, you know what this is where we are going as an organization, I know how to be one with the organization and because I have an ability of understanding the organizations that I work for those organizations open up to understanding me as well, and I do believe that with my abilities, you know, that integrity, that I spoke about that decisiveness that I spoke about, that self awareness that I spoke about. Um I I am the right candidate for for for this position and I really do look forward to being a part of this organization and I, you know, I think there's so much, I I'm not even I think I do believe there's so much that I am going to learn from this organization and there's so much that I'm going to give to this organization because first and foremost I believe in serving and honestly that's what makes a true leader, it's about your ability to serve and I have been 1/7 in all my working life. So I look forward to hearing from you. Um before before I forget, there's there's one more thing that I need to mention, I'm a very empathetic person and I think you know, I believe that's that's one of the most important things as a manager and as a leader, one should have. You know, I've kind of alluded to it in my explanation video, but I am putting it out there so that it is highlighted. Empathy is at the core of who I am, not only as a leader but as a person as well, integrity, communication, decisiveness, empathy.

I need to promote collaboration between everyone that are on the team and promote that you all you all have to work to the single so effective communication skills are really important. So as a manager, you need to communicates who your team, your goals, clearly your objectives. So that's really important and one of them and that's one of the things that I think I'm a good hat. Another thing that I think I'm good at is problem solving because when you have a lot of information data, you need to identify step by step solutions and what is the best method to resolve the issue. Because sometimes the best method, it is not the best because you also need to meet deadlines. So sometimes the best decision will take so much time that you will have to out for another another step or another path. So that's really important also and I think I'm good at time management as well because delegating tasks, tune the best people and the people that you think that will perform them well or especially in efficiently way that will not take a lot of time or or waste time doing the those those tasks. So that's important too. Another thing that I think it's really important when managing a team is that people need to see you as a leader or someone that they can Come up to two ask questions, feel comfortable talking to you, not feel intimidated, intimidating. And I think I can provide it to people. I I'm always trying to listening to people trying to make feel, make them make them feel better and I'm really open to people trying to make embarrassed choices and being happy at their work. So I am trying to do that as well and that's a skill that I need to, that I have one of the biggest weaknesses I think I would I would have is like mine, my communication skills, maybe sometimes I struggled to to put in words what I want to say, but I'm working on that, so that's one of my weaknesses",NEUTRAL,0.4392,0.0028,0.5552,0.0028,437.0,LOW,3,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),9.76,0,1,0,High school degree or equivalent (e.g. GED),Male,8.935116,8.657287,9.232586

Uh this is a position I've held before in my in my career and I found that one of the most rewarding things I've been able to do in my career. I originally started as programmer, did some time in documentation, so I feel I have a pretty good handle on both the development of the technology as well as documenting the technology. Most recently, my my team lead position was actually managing three of the these groups. One was a set of developers for a Web two point oh, distributed development environment where software was being developed using both the web capabilities that my team would produce an interface for as well as back in the back end knowledge of how the database that was containing all the deliverables from each development effort would be stored and accessed by our customer base. Um So I I enjoyed doing that and working with people that were who had technology knowledge that was to the second current, I was a little bit behind them, but I knew enough to know that I I could follow where they were going and we had a great relationship working that way because sometimes developers can be a little bit um concerned if their management, I have all the expertise that they do. I found that having enough and having a good ability to communicate, it can be really helpful in those circumstances and I was able to develop a strong rapport with the team as a whole as well as um individually Um the other team that I also lead at the same time was the documentation team. This, for me was a slam dunk because I've done that work before, documenting a uh an open source software program that was essentially used by 99% of the Fortune 500. So my my docs got a lot of visibility and in the course of doing that I really got a good feel for one, what it means to produce good docs and the type of you need to have with subject matter experts as well as the uh the people that will be using the docs to do their job. Um I learned some of the technologies in terms of offering and did a little bit of cutting edge work there by making sure that we had version control or change management as they might call it these days. The equivalent of something like gIT hub to keep all of our original source documentation for our docs, uh and we could, you know, version control those and have, I could have multiple writers working on a single file uh in different areas or I could have somebody basically bringing in together different threads from, say, a, you know, a beta development that then did turn gold in the deV team, we could bring beta documentation in a very similar way that the deV team did to bring their beta commits into the mainline for later distribution. Uh The last team that I managed during this time was also the quality assurance team and this was a new one for me, I've not had visibility into that aspect of the business, I found it fascinating and my team was great because they were, uh, you know, the QA guys were really good at kind of bringing me up to speed as to what their toolset was, how they were using unit tests too, make sure that new functionality got a lot of good coverage, you know, we produced weekly coverage charts for my weekly meetings with, with each of the separate teams, so I got a good handle on what areas were getting good coverage and had, and we're, we have into the quality of that code that the DEV team had produced, uh, and we're able to give them meaningful feedback if there were areas that they didn't write tests for, or they slipped something in on the infamous friday afternoon commit that then broke something and, you know, I was ready and waiting for the monday morning when the time came to pick up the pieces and get the next day. Um, beyond that, you know, my, my view towards managing people is to allow them to lead in many respects everybody because of who we hired, I looked into for hires, uh, were very skilled in their area of expertise, I looked for a certain level of interpersonal communication skills because that's really necessary to just work in, you know.",POSITIVE,0.8968,0.0064,0.095,0.0018,773.0,HIGH,11,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),6.33,0,1,0,"Bachelor's degree (e.g. BA, BS)",Male,8.98927,8.713104,8.581224

In this case, I'm looking to apply for a managerial role, which seems logical and makes sense why I would probably be asked about leadership. Um so historically or at least peripherally when people think of leadership, I think from the time people are Children for whatever reason, the term leadership is associated with bravery and uniqueness and sort of old fairy tales of black and white, good versus evil protagonist to antagonist. And I think those qualities are definitely the true, but I would say that leadership is much more, it's a much bigger and has a much larger scope of what are important attributes to compose and make up a leader than just bravery and uniqueness. So I want to talk a little bit about that, I think that the number one important starting point for a leader in a managerial business corporate position is somebody that has to be aware of details and willing to pursue details to to be a real leader. In this setting. You're not always going to be able to be, you're not always going to be able to just answer a question that is asked in many circumstances, you're going to have to go out and find what the question is before you can even answer it. So I think first and foremost leadership required A 10acity and an intellectual curiosity uh combined with a general sense of awareness to go and seek out objectives to seek out potential problems and then at that point what the leader does is the leader needs to come back to their group, their teammates, their subordinates, their colleagues, whatever the settings and inner workings of the personal um composition of the people network and frame work might be, but at that point then the leader needs to be a great communicator and the leader needs to communicate crisply clearly and often to all members in their scope. And this I mentioned earlier, colleagues and subordinates, it might also be in the sense of some um some configurations of personnel, you could be, you could also be contributing and communicating to your superiors and that's very common. And so ultimately what leadership is, is seeing out an objective or solving a problem from start to finish. And there's often not only one problem but multiple problems and multiple problems every day. And so once an objective or a problem is communicated, then it really needs to be followed up upon. And this is where managerial leadership is absolutely essential because it requires a daily awareness and adherence to staying on task, to understanding what progress has been made, what milestones are still outstanding in terms of completion, what obstacles or problems stand in one's way, how can we go out and solve those, what are the resources that we need or could need. And so so ultimately leadership is is really a fully scoped 360 degree purview of awareness of what needs to be done or what might needs to be might need to be done. And then how can I execute upon it? How can I execute upon it in terms of information plan, personnel, resources, whether that's equipment resources, capital resources, 3rd Party, internal, external. It simply requires vigilance and commitment.

Uh Part of the reason why I qualified for this position is because I do have a lot of experience in the field. I have experience working in multiple fields and multiple industries. These included working as a, you know, working in customer service relationships, where I worked in various industries such as call center industries, retail industries and uh as well as um you know industries like non for profits. All of these allowed me to have a broad definition of what you know leadership is, how leadership is applied in different levels and different layers with different sort of different types of employees. With different employees that you may work with, all of these um all of these uh you know, all of these industries that I've worked in all this experience helped me build those qualities that I believe allowed me for for me to be successful as a manager in in the position of listed above. Because you know, if we were to talk about retail, for example, I was able to deal with both customers and employees, fellow employees on a personal level, having spent longer shifts, having uh having the need to organize tasks and everything. All of that needed to be done in an efficient manner. And because that was done in an efficient manner, we were able to produce results the same thing in a call center, a call center allowed me to deal with customers over the phone, deal with people over the phone. And which is also another experience. And then for non for profits, I was I was able and I had the chance to deal with people in a more of, you know, in an approach where I could or where I could or I have to talk to the employee and I have to uh sorry, I have to talk to the client and I have to collect donations and I have to do uh you know, I have to be convincing all of that allowed me to be able to relate to. Sorry about that. So I had to be able to relate to employees and because I was able to relate with the employees here, you know, like this this will help me relate with employees and it will help me build great skills that I believe that I have for the job. So some of the skills that I have for the job would be like for example, kindness, sympathy, since I have a variety of experience dealing with customers, variety of experience dealing with different types of employees. I'm able to relate to people. Uh since I've been in their shoes, I've been in there in the position that they're they're in or they're going to be potentially in which I believe is going to be great for me in order for me to achieve results and when it comes to defining leadership. So, you know, like what I'm saying right now basically tells me that I'm a leader and I believe that for this managerial position, there should be a leader that is in in place, and I believe that a leader is someone that can relate that can walk the talk that can that can put himself in other people's shoes as and has has in other people's shoes as well as he can also provide results. I believe that I do have the experience and I do have the skills that fit into the criterion of me being sympathetic, since I have a lot of experience and a lot of experience. And then at the same time, during my work experience, in either either in other leadership positions or even as an employee, I was always able to deliver results. I was able one of the time, I was always one of the top performing employees. Also, even when we go back to school, when I was in school, I was always producing results, I was able, I was one of the highest achieving students. And as an employee, I'm also one of the highest achieving students, one of the highest achieving performance.

I would never ask anybody to do anything that I wouldn't and do myself. I've always used this and the fans were perfectly throughout my career, the more fair you treat people, I feel, the more people get back have you affair with people? They are more likely to go the extra mile. I'd like to create a professional way where experience for people and this provides the best results for me. I also believe in leading by example, have you set a good example and ask people to follow that. I believe that you should have no problems with your staff. I think the experience have gained, working with people from all um backgrounds. It's very important treat people as an individual. Not everybody responds to the same treatment. Some people may require a fair hand, but also, some people need the arm around the shoulder to be good at this old. When things go badly, not everybody responds to the same treat and this should be respected. I know from my own experiences, I've had bosses who have treated me badly and never respected me as an individual. Think this system most important part of being a bus two evaluate your staff and see how you can get the best out of them, Treat each one as a person and not as a number. The rewards are there for everybody. If we all achieve weight, strive to achieve what we set out to do at the end of the day, we are all here for the same reasons. We all want to you get rewards and hopefully where hard to achieve these. If you can get this across your stuff in whatever way expand, then I believe you will be successful. I believe I had these qualities to transmit to stuff and hopefully you will see these in in what I have said today. I am always open and I believe in an open door policy to stuff.

Um For some of the major names across the UK, My team at the moment is approximately 40 staff that's including internal and external people. Um and the largest team I have managed is approximately 100 staff. I'm a pragmatic leader, I'm an inclusive leader. I ensure that I listen to my staff, take time to listen to them, understand their point of view. I'm not afraid of making a decision and I will make a quick decision if I need to, but I prefer a much more democratic approach bringing people together, listening to everybody's opinion, listening to other people's opinion of their opinion before collectively coming to at the end point and and a final decision on the way forward if there is a better way to do things than the one I am proposing that I'm comfortable taking, that I developed my staff, I look at their skills and I ensure work allocated to them, pushes them not just meets their skills. I'm always quite pleased when people leave and go on to a better job. Um I don't always like that doesn't mean I like people leaving my team, but I do take some pride in the fact that they have developed their skills and improved themselves to go on to something better elsewhere. Um And that shows that there is progression for the other members of the team and it actually gives progression to those junior members of the team who want to move up into a newer and broader role, avoid in many, many different industries. So my experience is across many different types of organization. Manufacturing, financial sector, broadcasting. So I have quite a lot of skills in both regulated and non regulated industries and in particular in the financial industry and broadcasting, casting industry and insurance industry where they are governed by financial conduct authority and some very stringent rules on what you can and can't do more and more recently, I have been working with my management team and looking at diversity, um ethnic minority and how we can improve our inclusivity across the organization and specifically my team, we have put some measures in place partly guided by the new measures at organizational level and integrating with other teams across the business as well to make sure that we do get other people's view and opinion of both what we're doing, how we're doing it. So constantly looking to improve and develop the team for myself, I continue to learn and develop, I am doing a multitude of different project management program delivery training, most of it online, some of it face to face to continue my knowledge on more recent trends in that area. Again, my communication skills allow me to negotiate, but also empathize not just take a firm stand on my customers, my clients and my team, but working with my clients and building good relationships. Getting that trust set up and that trust in place is always important when you are looking at new client and looking to deliver to them in a partnership way, I'm quite open to being challenged. I'm quite open to being pushed.

But I also had to ensure that each partisans use were carefully considered because it's really important when leading a team to ensure that everyone feels valued and that the contribution is going to be take into into account boys that will fit morale not only to ultimately a worse performance. So when organizing each of these sessions, I ought to communicate with attendees in a 1-1 or where appropriate a small group basis. This really allowed me to build a really poor beach participant and each group of participants as well and make them feel valued and hopefully instill in them a good team environment, and also that their opinions were valued and valid and to actually encourage and contribute and to further the objectives of the group. Um, and it basically allowed me to appreciate an account for each individual's needs and opinions in a way that otherwise wouldn't have had the ability to ascertain what they needed from me hollowed out to work, how let's communicate, etcetera, but also, and allow me to understand their requirements in the, in the best way possible. Yes, this approach requires me to devote more time, but I think it's really important, two show stakeholders and team members that you're determined to go the extra mile by taking engagement beyond just generic emails. I ultimately wanted each stakeholder fuel, valued and included and this was again to encourage their participation and to increase the performance of the group. Yeah, recognition and praise of achievements is also an important lever that I've used in the past, both within and outside of meetings and again this is to boost morale and to basically champion a positive inclusive environment. There was an instance with this same group where a member of the team had achieved a significant feat certain summit and I really wanted to make sure that this was acknowledged the beginning of the meeting at the next meeting um setting the time for a very positive and productive discussion and in this example, despite working remotely and having never met each of the people who I was working with and who was leading, we ah you formed a very cohesive environment and a reliable network of contacts has been created for the benefit of my team and also other participants and that's really important is to the whole point of leadership skills, you need to think about the end goal while you're well, you're going about things in a certain way and what you really want to achieve out of it. There's no point in being bossy or being, you know, not listening to your team or, or being plaza and thinking I'm a leader to therefore do as I say, because that is not conducive for a positive environment. Ultimately what you want is to make a really strong team. And the best way to do that is to show that you're listening and considering people's views and you're understanding what they need and equally I understand what you need from them. It's also about being dependable, being honest, being reliable and again, those are key values I have instilled in me and in my leadership style example, I'll always be honest with my colleagues, bossy showing care in that as well. You know, there's times you can be too honest and that can actually lead to muddy relationships, but it's really important to ensure that you work from the people you are frank with them because that's the best way to proceed as a team. Again, being reliable people down. That's really important. Leading from the front as it were also taking people with you that's really important as I live to earlier and the same people's needs, creating that cohesive environment is ultimately what a leader is about and that's really what should be championed in any team that you lead.

So I'm really good at that. Also in addition to that my decision making is very strong. Uh I tend to I'm quick and making decisions usually they're the correct decisions based on in all the facts and the feedback that I get from my team and my peers, you know, I'm quick to make decisions and not linger on important decisions that need to be made. Um Also, um I tend to be a really good motivator, whether it's uh you know, within the company itself and also with my team and the people that are working under me, um I know how to coach and mentor them.

They need to you need to bring them together and make sure that you have friendly team environment. Also, I believe there is also positive conflict um where, you know, you have two people with two opposing ideas and it can lead to something much better and in a way you need to manage that, so it doesn't becomes something that's more becomes negative down the road where they believe that uh you know, uh their opinions and feedbacks isn't valued within the company and that needs to be managed.

So I've completed a number of different um managerial training courses. So in a previous role, I completed a six month training course which was in the house, it was specific to that um organization and it involves things like coaching skills, listening skills, crucial conversations. I've also supervised and land managed people throughout my career. So I've got a lot of experience with different types of people, different backgrounds, how to speak to people on different levels as well. I think one of the things that I pride myself on is making sure that my management approach is adaptable. So I'm not speaking to people in the same way. I think it's really important to realize that people learn and grow in different ways and making sure that you are approachable and adaptable to, that is really important. One of the things that I do at the moment is our land manage a number of different people um and they are at different Brandon's across our organization, which means that some people will be junior roles and some will be more mid level roles and I think it's important to make sure that you can adapt your approach and your expectations to those people. Um one of the things that I feel is really important is making sure that I'm approachable. So all of my staff know that they can approach me at any point either formally or informally to discuss anything with that be work related or whether it be a personal situation that they've got going on, that they need some support or some advice with. I've also completed some individual leadership training. Um, so that was actually through the NHS academy, it was specific to NHS systems and functions, which means that I can technically tech that qualification anywhere in the NHS in the UK and it will be the same standards wherever I go. Um Obviously systems and functions are slightly different depending on which organization you're written, but you do get sort of an all round training so you can understand the way that different teams work, that different trusts work and also different departments work. So even though I work with in mental health, some of the work, but I completed for the management training was in physical health, you also do different modules. So in older people's health, in working age, in Children and adolescents. So it's a really broad spectrum and I think having that knowledge um is really beneficial because although you might be in a particular situation, there are different people that you've got to communicate with within that. So it's not only communicating with the people that you support that you manage, but also the people that use the service and making sure that you are approachable for them because I think a lot of the time, particularly in mental health care, a lot of people don't want to engage purely because they feel like it's them versus the medical world. Um, and for me, I don't want people to feel uncomfortable in that. I think it's important that they can approach you in sort of a normal wear that don't have to big anything up, we'll talk about medical terms, etcetera, etcetera and and just make sure that they feel comfortable with that. I have also got my bachelors degree and part of the training that I did within that was a managerial um, marketing section and I think the marketing section really helped me to understand people's behaviors. Um, so I specify, sorry, specialized in consumer behavior and what makes people attracted to certain products or certain environments. Um, so I think I've got quite a good understanding of the psyche behind why people think the way that they do and also what you can do to influence the way that people think because again, that for me is a really important part of being able to lead and coach somebody and develop them, um knowing that they've got their own set of traits, but they're also the experience and the knowledge that you've got can help them bring that out further",POSITIVE,0.5882,0.0012,0.4103,0.0002,711.0,HIGH,11,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),14.06,0,1,0,"Bachelor's degree (e.g. BA, BS)",Male,9.18217,8.902267,8.477005

It's been a while since I've been working here has been around seven years, two of which I have served as a supervisor within the organization. So some of the reasons why I think that I would make a good manager would be that I'm motivated individual. Mhm. There's been many instances where we've had to cut slack and I was always there in order to help us get to that point. I also feel that my communication would be a big part of why we could this work. For example, it's a pretty good listener. Um This could make it so that I could listen to my underlings and come up with solutions to anything that they have an issue with. I would also like to keep a positive mindset throughout the entire organization as I feel like this is the best way in order for us to stay on track while also keep doing a good job. Having a positive mindset always leads to that's putting our best foot forward. I also think that I'm a responsible person responsible enough to take over in case of duress or anything that me come our way. And I also think that I'm an honest person. So in terms of me reporting to my superiors, I would also be honest to them. So in other words, my underlings, I would have to be honest with them if they're not doing a good job, I have to tell them if not there's going to probably be consequences and to my superiors, I'll have the telemetry is about, whatever it is, just so they stay informed and as I previously mentioned, I've been here for quite a while. So I know how the business operates. I know all its ins and outs. Now there may be other candidates for this position. However the odds are that they haven't worked in this space and as a result they probably don't have the knowledge that I do upon how things work here. This leads me to believe that as a employee here, I could formulate the best solutions, certain problems based on what I've seen. So previous managers have taken certain approaches to certain problems and I've noticed if they've worked, if they haven't worked and me like a support level and there would be less risk involved, I would know the outcome to many other solutions and for the solutions. I don't know the outcomes to I feel like I'd have the best chance of making an informed decision. Well I feel like that's all I have to say at this point.

I've been asked to present a short video to let people know what my leadership skills are like. Well, I've been around a long time now and I'm coming towards the end of my working life couple of years ago, I think. However, at the beginning of my working life I was in the military, I was in the British Royal Navy for five years and during this time I was promoted two or 3 times I was a communications uh, rating rating is the word that they use for a person who works on border ship. I was working with radios communication back in those days including mosque code. Uh During that time I continued to study and went on courses and worked my way up to where I was running the radio room uh and had two or three people under me and we had to make sure that all the communications from the ship went to the correct place anywhere around the world. We had to know about ciphers and as the leader, I was tasked with keeping the secret ciphers in the safe and knowing how to use them. And I think this gave me quite a good background for being able to work with people and to get people to do the things that I needed them to do. Uh huh. Consequently, when I left the Navy, I decided that I would work for myself rather than going into an organization. Working for somebody else. At first, it wasn't easy little by little. I began to progress as a self employed person and we were buying properties, small properties and renovating them. So during this time I had to use people to work for me and contractors came in and I would be in charge of them. Uh and I think my leadership was shown there really because we did quite well. Um we upgraded several properties, overcame problems and I had to work with uh local councils had to pass on the information to my workers and to my contractors. And this uh gave me the confidence to then later in life to go on and expand to change the business I was in and always having as you do in business to get people to do the things you need them to do in order to be successful. I think that uh my work with the house renovation gave me a particularly good leadership skills because to get people to do the right kind of work, mm particularly in the building trade is often difficult and there can be difficult times when you need to lay people off from a job who are not performing correctly and get somebody else in. For instance, if you've got a person who claims to be a plasterer and they have to plaster an entire house once they've done one room, you go in and inspect it and if you're not happy with the work they're doing, then you have to bring them to one side and tell themselves and quite often you have to get rid of them. There may be some discussion over this, but you're the boss and you have to have your work done properly. Yeah. And so I got very used to dealing with people and dealing with professionals with solicitors and planning clerks in the council, etcetera, and not through bluster and not through trying to be bossy, but through understanding people, getting them to see my point of view.

I try my best to bring out the best in each of my employees. I asked for for their input. When we have assignments that need to be completed, I team build and I get a groupthink together with everybody and then I individually go out to each of his will employ and try to make sure that they understand what we need to do and how my and and show them my vision of what we know how to get there but also then take input about their understanding and their vision of what what, how we might get, where we're going to go. So I often do this all the time when we have you know larger scale events but there are times where I'm going to need to take the lead and make sure that they do if they do things that need to be done, maybe possibly my way, it is not always they're going to have the ability to sway me but I definitely want their input with regards to um the different activities and assignments that we have. I um I'm a very personable person so I try to, whenever I am remember I am making sure someone do something I want to make sure that they understand that I also have a stake in what they're doing now. I may not have the same responsibilities that they do but I want to make sure that they understand that I fully understand all of the aspects of the job that they're doing because I think that a supervisor has to maintain at least a certain amount of understanding of what each of his subordinates or her subordinates does in order to be fully um able to supervise those people who are below them on the on the on the ladder of the company. So I want to make sure that I'm first in and keeping up to date on all of the things that go into their job as well as obviously keeping them more of a global view um to in order to supervise these these these employees.

Hi my name is thomas Shannon, I've been a leader in the recruitment sector for seven years now, three years in my current capacity where I manage our relationships with clients. I also managed a team of three recruitment consultants. Um So I have extensive experience within this uh this field um That comes from a solid operational level experience. I was a recruiter myself for five years before moving into leadership. In that capacity, I was a successful recruiter, so I know the role that my team are doing kind of inside out and so I'm able to give them a lot of hands on really solid day to day advice, but I'm also able to operate a more strategic level in terms of um recruitment and growing our team managing the data and the finances behind the success of the team um and also work with senior stakeholders within our business. Um In terms of my leadership style, I like to lead by example, I'd like to be in the office early every day, I like to stay late and I'd like to be visibly busy. Um So the team are able to use me as an example of of success and how to how to progress their careers. Um I'm also very hands on in terms of regular training sessions, regular wash up sessions with the team where we are able to discuss problems and scenarios um together uh and find solutions together. And this is really important because it creates a culture of sharing of ideas and experience um which which pushes us all forward. So yeah I think that's that's that's really valuable um outside of that I am. I'm somebody that I do regularly um Professional development plans with the teams on a monthly basis. We reviewed the previous month in terms of our activity, our successes or challenges. We review both to see how we could have done better, how we could improve and incorporate that into apply to the next month activity so that we're always Always looking for those incremental gains. I'm also someone who is quite conscientious. I read a lot of management and leadership books, try to bring that into into my team. Um you know, I often talk about the 1% rule within our today in terms of Trying to be 1% better in a certain area of our work every single day. Um We can see the kind of examples of that. I'm always looking at different examples and different methodologies that the team can use in order to um to to improve them to push their performance. Um so again, I think that's really important and I try to build a culture where the team also, whether it's podcast, whether it's Youtube, whether it's linked in training sessions, whether it's breeding, brought, create a culture where were openly talking about development on a regular basis and we're actively pushing forward towards that. So again, I think that is a really important factor in, in leadership is setting an example is set in that town. Um also bringing people into the team that share those same values, being very selective about who you bring into the team, incorporating the team into that decision making. So they feel part of those decisions and they feel that this team is ours, it belongs to all of us, and so we all have a shared responsibility for the success of the team and for the work that gets put into learning that success. So I think it's it's very much about that sort of that culture, including people into decision making, trying to set a strong example, um ultimately being somebody there who was who's been through the challenges that they have been through and can bring um solid practical advice to the table to help people in to improve day to day.

I feel like in general it's just important to understand people and understand the things that they're going through this importance. What to be able to sympathize over people. No actually understand why they're going through things and how we can improve it. I feel like this is good because in general your relationship between you and even your coworker or you or your employee would actually increase and become stronger than the bond would become stronger in general. This means that you and tim could probably work together and even create better products and just make your business better in general. It could also lead to you making higher quality products. So even if it's something like a burger, it would be actually amazing at rather than just average if you and your other co worker didn't know each other at all. I also think something to take note of this. Actually, I'm very fond of equity um is I feel like it's important to understand the equity and equality actually have to drastic differences. one in the fact that booth people normally have the misconception that it just means people are getting the same thing but actually inequality. You were everyone is getting the same thing despite their circumstances despite anything or anything that is about them. That skin sand can was of equity. I feel like for example if it's a short man and he can't see a game, he would need the largest store than a tall man. You can already see the game just for them to reach the same level. So I feel like as a leader in a company, I'll be able to give employees different things, different types of help so that both all different types of employees can be at the same page with the same level which as I feel very important Does have a lot of confidence because just at the age of 19 I had to perform multiple projects in front of people and it and it was nerve wrecking. I have to be completely honest, it was nerve wrecking, especially in the new workplace like metal steel associates, but I still did that and I constantly did that and gradually actually developed this type of confidence. I feel like it shoot it for leader. I also feel like I have a lot of emphasis towards team working. I felt like teamwork and is extremely important because there's no, there's no I in team, whatever that sounds cringe or not is actually a fact that even as a leader is impossible for me to do all things for myself. I also feel like teamwork is the higher efficiency, me being able to do more things as a team will lead to better progression in my business in general, which I feel like it's really important. Also have good computing skills as well, which means I'm quite good with technology that can normally see around things like technological errors. If you understand what I mean. This means that towards like a business and all the data and the management will be able to solve that through and I'll even be able to teach other people in that to the everyone in the business that I'm leading will be able to do this. We'll be able to have good computing skills. I can also create power points that can create Microsoft would on things.

I hope that what I can to give you an example, this one guy who joined, he'll show it before me, but I didn't really have any respect for anyone. So When we had our stand ups who refused to comment in the meetings, even though as a quick 500 and I would sit down with him and discuss what he would like, where what let's do um in his career, what why he would not like to attend the meeting, which we all tend to attend um And once I got to know him I did kind of open up and I felt that he just thought because he was quite old, they're not given the respect. So eventually I did have a team meeting and I gave him, um, front rows Wednesday frankly. I mean I gave him the chance to enforce his opinions and I felt he felt confident that he was able to, she talk and express his opinions and feelings. And because of that, he, I decided then to turn up to all the stand up. So we had to have a mandate morning. Um, he gave the respect which deserved.

He kind of close to the time when he just didn't want to adapt and change the way he, he worked.

My name is George and I'm here to talk about leadership skills in the context of me and what I can do. So I have a number of years of management experience, but perhaps the most relevant is that in 2009 I set up a business in the employee business benefits industry and With a team of three people, We eventually built a business that had a turnover of $900 million dollars In five different companies And countries and we had 500 staff. That business was profitable within two years And we sold the business for Â£140m to an american private equity company. So I think in terms of numbers that probably helps to speak for itself, but in terms of what did I bring to the party as a leader, I guess it was the ability to have a vision and to share that vision in an engaging fashion with a group of people that are prepared to work long hours and give maximum commitment towards a shared goal, which was to be the best employee benefits provider, not only in Britain, but probably the world. Hence why we were able to sell it for such an attractive price After only six years of operation. And for me, my leadership style is all about setting some broad big picture parameters and then enabling the team that I work with to interpret those parameters and to deliver results. I don't micromanage, I'm very supportive and I'm willing to step in and give the benefit of my experience as and when it's required, and sometimes when it's not required, if we are about to make a potentially fatal error, also have high tolerance of errors within my approach to leadership. And essentially the reason for that is I feel after several years of entrepreneurship, the only way that you learn and can move on successfully is to actually make mistakes and to accept those mistakes, but to build better after them, if everything's going swimmingly, then uh you're in danger of becoming extremely complacent. So to summarize for me, it is really about having a clear vision, having the commitment to deliver that vision and being able to assemble a dedicated team around you, of people that have a mix of experience can do and collaboration skills and we're able to engage customers with that vision to the extent that those customers don't want to be anywhere else other than without business. I think also from my perspective, it's very important to get the finance right, because so many businesses fail as a result of not looking after their cash flow correctly. And so to that extent, uh we always had a very strong finance capability, but not a capability that got in the way of us doing business and being able to secure the opportunities that we needed to secure, which means taking risks, but optimizing those risks in such a way that we can maximize our market share growth and a turnover and our bottom line.

Uh First of all thank you for taking the time to interview me for this uh coin management position within the eighties and department. Uh I've been working in the I. T. Department for several years and they've got some very very good big ideas to improve the performance of the department and the staff morale. Uh huh. And it wouldn't actually cost anything towards the business. It's just a matter of tweaking a few things here and there that we already do. Mhm. So first of all necessary you've got any objections to improving uh with no costs implicated. Please let me know. Okay fantastic. So first of all I'm thinking that we shouldn't really be held sourcing. I believe the costs for using our third party database management company is excellent. Earlier I believe we could do away with this as it's an awful lot of money towards the business for the cost per year. We can actually bring in three in help database managers. We could have them sitting with the Tt day in day out and it wouldn't actually cost Anywhere near what we've actually got from the 3rd party. Not only that we could actually bring in another member towards the applications for two and that is all for people from getting any one company that one company. Yes sure. They have a lot of employees but we only generally deal with two maybe three airports when we truly need them. But with it it brings us three dedicated database managers and also one extra application support analyst as well who we could search for. And if we look for somebody that I tell trained already or SDA qualified, we can cut costs there as well because we wouldn't need to train them my sons and send them off to the course to get trained. They'd already have that qualification. We could also look for somebody who has certain degrees rather than just specifying that you need a degree qualification, you know, specialist morning computer science or pendants taken database analyst, uh sort of quantitative bolt onto their degree as well. Not only that I think that we need to put more investment within our company's equipment. So the laptops that we currently have, we have a great deal with hp to be able to buy these and we have them on a buyback system so that they roll over etcetera uh every three years we'll send them back provided they are in great quality, they will give us generally a third of what we've spent on them back, which then helps us to them by new again, which is awesome. But the fields of what we need to do is look at it and not just by the mid range machines, they are powerful enough. And I think that we should look at getting the highest back, especially for the manager and the senior of the department so that they can be more proactive and also more efficient. But I say I think the entire team should also get those highest back models. Maybe not as high processing but definitely increased ground on. Uh I think it would help, especially with dealing with sequel, database queries, etcetera. But that's just a few ideas that I've got that if I was in management, I would be putting forward to the board to help court costs but also helping to fund the department and get a wealth of knowledge in house so that we are more effective and efficient. But yeah, that's a few of the ideas are half she wants to go on board of any groups, like maybe one.

I have a wealth of experience in managing all different sorts of people uh through mainly working in medical stroke healthcare settings. And also I have a fundamental understanding of health and safety. So my priority is always to look after the staff. I try and build a personal relationship with everyone. Supposed to terminology would be man management. So investing some time getting to know each individual think benefits in the long run and then just trying to keep an even playing field to giving people the opportunity to make mistakes. But also using copies to assess people's understanding of the roles and give them something to achieve over the course of a year. Mm hmm appraisals may happen Every 3 to 6 months depending on the person involved. But I like to keep her blanket management school set for folk just to keep it as an even playing field so they can achieve promotions. Always much better to promote from within. So star feel invested. They may achieve something, but also rightfully feeling that folk are able to stay in position. It's that they currently help hold for many different reasons. People sometimes like they rung on the ladder and that helps build a, a shared team and a good experience. Now personally, for the role coming in to the twilight of my career. So I think experience sadly cannot be replicated through anything else. It's not to be ageist, but I think in all honesty, I'd be the right man for the job. And I think in all honesty, you've been making a fantastic decision if you were to select someone like myself for running up the management and health and safety services of this establishment. And I'd like to think after That six month probation period you would be more than happy to commit to a more long term plan. And hopefully with me at the helm, I think this could be a very fruitful and successful relationship, not only for ourselves as business owner manager, but also for the staff and all clientele involved. Thank you very much indeed. I think I'm just running down to the end of this interview today and I really appreciate your time.

I do the research to ensure that uh we have the we have all the necessary tools and all of our partners are involved with us, whether it's other parts organization, both internally and externally as well. Another thing that really exemplifies my leadership is that have a good communication background and a strong ability to lead people, meaning that I'm able to give an assignment, communicate it out, go, step by step, explain the why behind why we're doing a particular task, our function and then showing the results as well. I think that's important for a team to see, okay, why are you doing it? But then also what is the importance of doing it? And I think that's extremely important when you're when you're in a leadership role. Another factor that feel strongly exemplifies who I am as a leader is that I'm very highly attention to detail, meaning that I take the time to ensure that each part of the process is done correctly and I go back and ensure that if there is any sort of confusion or or something doesn't seem right, I make sure to resolve it through communicating to my team and my partners that we're on track and then we're good to go. I feel that's very important, definitely having a strong attention to detail. Another factor that I feel really exemplifies my ability to be a leader is that um, what I feel is really strong about me is that I take the time two at the end of a project to reflect and ask questions, asking questions such as was this process the best way to do it? Maybe there was a better way to do a task always learning and growing. I feel that in this particular role, um, as a manager that you can never really stop learning and growing. So for me, it's very important to take the time to go back, see how I did things and say to myself, is this the only way that it could have been done, could have been done differently. It could have been done better. It's just the only way that I could have done this and I think taking the time to do that can definitely bring some really strong results, not only for myself as far as learning growing, but also for the organization itself. The last thing I want to touch on and it while last but definitely not least, it's confidentiality, I'm very good about strong and ensuring that information is kept private, that's supposed to be remaining private. So in other words, if there's something that's being discussed in a meeting or a plan or a document or with a colleague that I ensure that at all times all that information is kept private and confidential. So no one outside the, that group organization is aware of what we discussed. That's extremely important to me building that trust and loyalty. Uh, the last thing I would like to leave on is that I'm very motivated. I'm very dedicated. Ah, I like to get a job completed.

Um partially because I have a great deal of management experience at a lot of different levels. My management experience started all the way back in university when just by pure chance, I was actually made the general manager of a 41 room property. Um just down the road from a major big 10 university and all of the different management challenges that I had to face At the young age of 20 years old. Um really allowed me to learn how to interact with people in a way that kind of placated them and allowed me to validate their concerns. But at the same time, Even though I was 20, years younger than most of these people, I was able to assert my authority and still garner their respect. Mm hmm. As I've grown older into other management positions, I have become very comfortable with managing as part of a group. And understanding that all good managers don't understand that they don't know everything. What I do is I hire the best people that I can find. I've known managers that don't do, that. I've known managers that feel challenged or threatened by people that are very talented. That they are afraid that they're going to possibly lose their position if they hire people that are too good. I am simply the opposite. I try to hire the best people that I can And especially people that might have skills that are different than mine and what that will do is that will ensure that my team will be well rounded and that we will be able to function exceptionally well as a unit and will, I will be able to leverage those skills that I don't possess all that much of. But I'm very much into collaborative management. So I I all of my team very much knows that I am the final decision maker, but I've made it abundantly clear to my team that I want their input, I want their honest input and when we are in closed doors, they are very much able to respectfully tell me how they truly feel about certain issues and I'm also very open and honest with them. And while I can't share all information that I might know about a certain situation that I might have learned from C suite members, VPs and Ceo SEO is that kind of thing I do share with them as much information as I can to try to explain to them some of the decisions that I've had to made or make that might be contrary to their wishes. But what I want my subordinates to understand is that I want them to speak up. I want to get their ideas, I want them to feel involved because I feel that that's going to make my team and overall and then the overall business do a much better job. If those people feel like they have a big part in the decision making of the business. I think that's kind of the secret sauce to management is keeping people engaged and involved. I'm also a big advocate of continually working on employee development. I know that I'm not going to keep my most talented employees where at the position that they're currently at. In fact, in a good manager, shouldn't want to, a good manager should be constantly developing their employees the different skills, helping them go in the direction that they want to go. Whether that would ultimately mean rising at their current company or ultimately knowing that you're going to lose them to another company. But that's what a good manager does. And so every 3-4 months I meet with each one of my employees, and we I want to solicit feedback from them. I want to provide feedback to them and we go over there individual employee development kind of task or list and see how they're, how they are working towards their own individual development goals, as well as departmental goals.

So I did um many courses which improved my problem solving skills. Um So I you know I'm really good was numbers and problems which a manager should be expected to do. Yeah. Um Not just that I also um headed a uh tutor group um So I was the head due to in second year and what this what this entailed was I had to delegate um the other teachers into positions and give them tasks which would benefit the students most. So the problems I had to deal with involved um managing the time the students had versus how much we could help them but also not helping them too much such that we you know don't teach them anything so you kind of weak. I I kind of had to deal with this this 34 problem that that that had three Dimensions to it. So that gave me a lot of experience in managing people, not just people but you know as well as customers the students because you know there are that this is their dissatisfaction uh you know um was apparent. Um So that was that was uh as many people as I ah That was the most people I managed up to date, there were there was about 6, 6 people.

So I always try to reach an agreement with both parties so we can be on good terms and not have any grievances or any anger because you don't want any employees coming back to like fight you back and just stuff in the future if they do ever not come back. So of course you always want to discuss it with them and just find out what their issues are and talk to everybody maybe do some voting and poles and all sorts just so you don't leave anyone out as I always want to have a resolution for everything although or maybe a tad bit tad brush, we're still in quiet times we all need to be realistic because everyone has their own opinions so we need to try and make a a buffer so we can always just get the right amount through. So as a leader I would always listen to people's opinions but also put my own knowledge first as well just so we can be confident in what we're doing so any choices I will use all knowledge will get as much as we can before you do any big things and some other abilities would include having active listening skills. So I was asking questions to make sure I know what I just heard and always try to plan ahead. So I know what is coming up next because we will need to listen, we have to have the keys so we can listen every time then we can always get the best decisions made and that's what's keener discussion and you have the eye contact and always just be out just to get the best solution and why I would say I'm the best candidate for your managing position is because I always try to get a resolution and I'm able to help others that will, so it can be successful business as when everyone is happy, the business will thrives or make it my goal to always get the best out of others, whether it is constantly checking on them to see how they're doing. So we can always get the best out of them, see how their mood is and what's going on with their work, having regular training and meetings and general conversations. So we may, even in the future have get togethers, whether it's personal or group depending on what my staff would prefer. So we can all make it together. So everybody's happy if people can't come at certain times we can go through that I would also like to say. But as I've been doing volunteering and other sorts of things. I've given my confidence up and I always try to do stuff that's not in my comfort zone. Such as the volunteering which I thought it would be weird traveling and doing all of that stuff. But when we went with other people and we worked together and helped people in the gardens and it was just learning and asking questions. That's key in anything what I've learned there. And in previous places I've worked I have always tried to listen ask questions, produce ideas such as ticketing system and making that helping for their I. T. In the computers and managing all the computers and we're doing tests as well. So I'd like to say that as well. And anything else that I would say is I always try my best and as a leader I can make everyone up because I know the problems that can come with working in a new place or always try to get people together meetings. Make them have a good camaraderie. So we all can be one.

Um I had started off in um more professional environments, but also in very junior roles, and but I moved out into The insurance industry um in my mid 20s and it was a very, a very brief stint that I actually spent at that firm, but that that was the first time when I was actually given real responsibility and also when I was actually really encouraged to think about what it took um to to actually encourage people to reach their full potential. So what we were often dealing with were in the insurance industry, people who were between the 16 to 19 years old, essentially coming in fresh into their first jobs straight from school and what you were essentially trying to do well some to attend essentially take, if you like, growing up skill pupils and turned them into young adults, um young adults who could work um in a sort of business environment. Um So part of that, um as I found, and it's one of the things that stood me in good stead was too to actually um delegate worthwhile work to them. So the the sort of things that might be sort of typically thought of as management functions, chairing meetings and the like, um we would we would rotate that every week throughout the team meeting, so there was that element of it, the element of sort of developing um the skills of people, but the other aspect that I hadn't expected, I would like um was that although my management style um, is to sort of try and be one of the team to try and makin this, there's no doubt in a crisis, all eyes turn to you and that was a sort of bit that I that I really, really thrive town. Um the reason I I thrived on it was that um, I was forced to come up with a system for thinking on my feet and that if you were presented with a situation where all eyes on you, which usually demanded an immediate answer, it also demanded a sensible answer. So the very simple rules of thumb that I would that developed was that in the crisis, in the situation where we needed something done immediately. Um we will try to take the simple option. Um Not only that we were trying to take an honest option and we would also try to take a long term option. This is one of the things um I used to try and tell people um is that in a crisis situation you do want simple rules of thumb because the alternative and the alternative is bad management is that you take decisions that are complicated, you take decisions that are dishonest and you take decisions that are short term and that you end up um ultimately going down the wrong path.

So I wanted to talk to you today about my leadership abilities and skills and why it makes me the most qualified candidate for the audit manager position. I feel that my 31 years of audit experience um will play will pay dividends in my ability to lead an audit team. I have extensive experience in auditing, both operational, financial regulatory and socks as well as other components which would be your vendor audits, your outside compliance audits um and any type of fraud auditing as well. So that's why I feel that my skill set makes my candidacy the utmost paramount for this position. And I also feel that um I am able to extract the best out of my team because I can do that through persuasiveness and working with my team members and helping perform the best audits possible. So I really feel that my skill sets in communication ability, my skill sets in technical and financial expertise, my ability to utilize emotional intelligence when I'm talking with. Um Oddities for employees that are subordinates to me, I'm able to get the best out of them and I'm able to have them perform at the top of their ability. So those are some of the areas that I feel um make me the ideal candidate for the audit manager position. Additionally I have project management skills, I have banking and finance um and electronic payment background. Um I am a certified internal auditor. So I've passed the examination, I passed it over 11 years ago and it is still in good standing, so that also separates me from the herd. Um and I feel that you know these are all of the areas that make me a profound leader and somebody who can extract the best out of associates and employees within the division. I feel that leading them by example is the best way to get them to follow exactly the directive and culture that the company wants to instill. So by showing them that you know, your hard work and determination will lead you to a path within management. Then they will also be feeling that they can achieve greatness and will have that drive and desire to follow you and make sure that uh they don't let you down. So those are some of the areas that um you know I've worked on in the past, I've taken a number of self improvement courses. Um I've studied um you know ad nauseam on things about managing people and leading by example and setting forth the tone and culture of an organization. And I really feel for audits since you're held to a higher standard is something that must be portrayed because if you're not trusted as the auditor then many people will not trust your recommendations or any of the information that you're providing them and thereby it also makes it difficult for you to lead. So I feel that setting that exemplary tone um definitely something that I can go ahead and and perform and have people follow me and make it the best management position within the company.

Um It's something I'm really passionate about and I feel I would be an asset to your company and I'll take you a bit through my background and explain why I think I would be suitable for this role. So um firstly, um yeah, I was from a musical family. So all my, my parents actually met playing in an orchestra and they brought me up with music around and I loved it from a from a young age. In fact, even when I was in my mother's womb, she, she was playing and performing around different hotels and um as well as in the opera. So it was constantly before, even before it's born. So when I was very young, I think I was about to 33 years old. Um I started the violin at that age and then um I entered lots of competitions, gained lots of experience performing and we performed as family and I also were then later on went to A music school, very prestigious one. So I went to Wells Cathedral Cathedral School, Land of Cathedral School and had such a fantastic background there really and also picked up some more subtle things about how people run things from music departments and all sorts. So it's uh that was really good. And then um I went to music college, I got my Bachelor's of Music degree and I got my Master's music degree as well, this was from trinity college and during my time there they actually had different outreach projects. So we would go around local schools promoting music to lots of Children and hoping they will take up music and you have to have good communication skills already at that stage, when you're in college to organize with your peers about rehearsing and about arranging with the school's about when to come in. So this was already helpful. And then, yeah, I've had a 13, 4, 13 year teaching career so far. Um and there's a lot of, not just teaching, but uh you realize there's like planning involved and how to plan for each individual, not just every lesson, but in that lesson. So when you're teaching in groups, sometimes you get different abilities, so you arrange in parts for everyone as well, and I'm very friendly, I get on well with everybody and I think as a leader, I would be strong, but fair, I'm very organized. So I'm always up at the crack of dawn and I got the diary and really know what I'm doing for every moment of the day. Um and I know, you know, certain things with music is very important like funding. So I would make sure the Arts council really uh, you know, be emailing them constantly asking for more money. Um and setting up local projects as well, and also charity work. So we get revenue coming in um to help fund like low income families who, and they might not be able to afford music lessons in this school and it's very, very important that they get given an equal opportunity. Um Not just the low income families, but people from different backgrounds as well, everyone should get an equal opportunity and I'm a strong believer in that. So that's very important. And setting out lots of projects with schools, of course we'll have a close team around me which will really really help. Um And yeah, allocating the work between us will be quite quite good. I'll be fair, I'll make sure I, you know, if anybody's got any problems, my door is always open, so more than welcome to bring the problems to me and I'll do my best to sort them and if not I'll take it.

I've learned a lot about the workplace, what the proper protocol is within the workplace and how to manage that effectively so that employees have a great experience at work between my leader scriptural my leadership skills. And also I believe that my ability to manage my ability to work with people rather than working for, I can work with people to improve every aspect of the HR department of this company. And I have found that this job has taught me that I enjoy working with people very much and that through working with people, I most certainly can improve my overall skill set can really fit into this role of HR manager. Um we're working in HR I've learned many things about the workplace, what the right thing to do is what the wrong thing to do is and I feel like with this extra knowledge there is, I have a vast understanding of what needs to be done, what needs to be done to have a coherent company with employees, you feel like they have a voice. If they have issues, they can come to our department. And that is very important to me. This this whole idea of employees being able to come to me with a problem whatever it is within the workplace because as we all know, workplaces can be very unpredictable places, money, many things can go wrong, People can fight, there could be many, many things that can go wrong. So I most certainly value the ability for an employee to come with any issue that they may have. And I think that is the key to help to creating a healthy company because of your employees aren't happy. Well then product productivity is low, you have bad review, people bad reviews, people leave what they've worked, employee reviews from were working there, you're going to see less qualified people coming into the job. People who your best candidates will want to give you a miss as a company. If reports come back from ex employees that it was a bad work environment and there was no help from the HR department because the HR department is very much the backbone of keeping a company upright in a sense, we're not the premier function in generating income generating revenue, but most certainly in terms of keeping every cog in the machine working, keeping every cog happy, I suppose. Um the HR department is absolutely parallel to that and I feel with my leadership within the HR department, I can bring and I can bring a very um yeah, very good improvements to have because of the current situation, I would want to have more emphasis on anonymous reports like to gather information about the work environment, how people feel within a do surveys to see your people happy to see our people struggling somewhat with maybe some aspects of the workplace.

I've been recently been one of the managers in the store called super value convenience stores. And over there, one of my main aim was to look into the logistics on what to order. And so so recently we have been having a lot of issues that it I think if you have looking into the current things has been happening now there's been a huge delaying whole supply chain. And for us we had to take an intense decision and I just know what to do next because each one was a critical one since the all the covert and stuff we have to look into the proper one as a manager. What I used to do is I used to do a lot of forecasting and during my, during my first days before being a manager I used to do a lot of things like doing proper forecasting, keeping up to date information, knowing what things could happen because for me for some reason I to love to do forecasting and many people saw this one of a good trading to me and people started getting into me started knowing how I used to do it and we started developing a huge bond. So what I used to do is making a huge bond and by making proper bond, having a problem for casting skills, taking the proper decisions since forecasting help on that people saw this as one of the good traits and they started they promoted me and they are recommended me from being a low level manager, not a low level manager to a low lit from to the middle level.

So if you are a leader and you're not doing anything as properly properly, people will find it a offensive or maybe they might be led to misleading things and it may have which may affect their progress and which will bring a huge downfall for the organization. So what I used to do is on the side cause I used to go and hit to take a different kind of leadership skills like taking short term courses and sometimes getting some insights from other people who I presume that kind of a proper leader and from them, I was able to know what I have to do next in order to bring what bring my people to do what they have to do. The rest of the things that I used to do as a leader is take decisions lead to people and the main thing and stood solve problems there might be, there might be conflicts between also about nature and it is to be here frank, it's a pain in the house. It's such a pain, you have to deal with these people, These people keeps on crying like a small, maybe based on certain simple things and as a leader you have to go a step inside and you have to step them aside and you have to make them proper because if the problem over there is not solved on the spot, that's what I believe. If it's not solved on the spot, it would be a small pin in the skin and it would start affecting you gradually as you progress and that burden keeps on climbing up. So at the beginning state itself, if you can able to solve it, it would help your people to move in and whatever, help them even to grow and help them to improve their quality of work and would help them to achieve each goals as well. So these are the things that I used to do as a leader that is a, I used to do it forecasting, maine recently used to forecast, saying that actually helps me too take proper decisions, which is one of the most important thing of a leader. And second is communication on how to communicate each and others, having a proper strong communication with them would actually help them in knowing you more better. And they would start putting trust and faith in new york and taking proper decisions and solving things next, solving problems between all the subordinates because doing that is one of the main thing because since you're a leader you have followers. And if there is a fight between followers as a leader, you won't be able to move on. So these are the three things that I used to do, two. Get myself done and be a proper leader.

I have been self employed in the information technology field. Managing employees that are older than me for many years 13 to be exact. In my position, I have had to manage disputes, determine where my employee strengths lie and coordinate project. I believe being a manager is a hands on position that requires as much effort put forth by me as the employees underneath. It is my job to ensure that projects from smoothly, even if that requires extra work on my end. I have been in the position of unemployed before and I'm well acquainted with project deadlines and having to put in a lot of effort to get work done. It can be a stressful time for everyone involved, especially if it seems if management is not helping. As a result, I am able to relate well with my employees and determine where their priorities lie. In addition, I'm good at managing disputes, whether my employees are struggling with new software workload or even collaborating with others. I have had experience in being able to guide them to a resolution that works for everyone. I once had an employee struggled with work due to personal reasons. In order to maintain a good workplace environment. I gave them the day off to help resolve their issues and personally took on the work they had to do. I am not afraid of taking on burdens if it means I get the best results from my staff. I am keen to analyze my employees work performance both past and present to see which areas they perform best in This can also be evaluated by one and 1 or team meetings where they have the freedom to express which work they might do most. I find it is important to have happy work environment to get the best results. Sometimes that means I have to pick up the slack where my employees struggle, even if it means I have to work overtime or take on more commitments and happy to do so, provided it maintains how many in the team under me and gets the best end result for upper management or clientele, it is the job of a manager do the best job for those under their employ. However, I accept that sometimes work is not desirable and that being a manager does not mean my employees will like me. My priority is to maintain a good workplace through cordial relationships with my employees not to be their friend. Nobody wants the Michael scott. I am not afraid to allocate work. My employees may not like. It is essential to the job. Sometimes becoming proficient in something is not due to natural desire and sometimes the borealis work is essential in search of case. I have witnessed my employees proficiency instead tasks improve over time, even if they do not come to enjoy it. At least I know we can do it in summation. I have experienced in mitigating potential fallouts and staff allocating employees to the jobs that best shoot them and organizing employee workloads that projects run smoothly and believe I can apply these experiences in the job that is being offered to me to increase overall productivity and keep employees content within their assigned positions.

So I would like to talk about my leadership capabilities because I believe that I am an excellent fit for the job. My leadership abilities have been nurtured from an early, from an early age, I was a boy scout and I actually, I was given many responsibilities which made me a better leader, a leader that I am today. Some of these responsibilities were organizing meetings. They were, I delegating tasks to other to other boys at camping trips or other expeditions. I culminated in a giant project in which me and my troop cleaned up an entire park. And this is a project that organized by myself. It's an art project that I oversaw and it was a monumental task, one of the most difficult ones in my troop and we were able to complete it exceptionally well. It was commended by the park and it basically showed me that I did have the potential to be a very good leader. Now this potential was nurtured on furthermore, in college, I have studied business administration and my classes consisted of very, very um sorry of real world business simulations. And essentially we were test uh we're test to complete simulations were such as being in on our work on a team in a firm or in creating an entrepreneurial idea or other business ventures. So for these power was not, leadership was not necessarily delegated to me, it was more of assumed it because I always wanted to always take a leading role in these things and because I have these skills because they were nurtured from a young age, people generally accepted it. So I managed to leave my teams into and to success. We exceeded the standards of whatever assignments we had to do and I was able to grow my solider through these, I was able to notice my pitfalls and correct them and in subsequent and subsequent tasks I did better and better. No honest for my press. For me personally, I would say that my main, the main things that make me a good leader are that I'm decisive or that I'm proactive and because I always keep a clear head, I'd never let my emotions take control and I always consider all options while I do listen to my subordinates in any situation. I don't try to be conciliatory towards them. Or should I say, I do not make that the this is the norm. If they have a good idea, then I will accept it. If they have good criticism, I will accept it, but I will not listen to them just for the sake of listening to them. I will do it and they have a good idea. And through this I'm I'm able to lead. I'm able to lead with good ideas and are able to lead decisively and I'm always able to keep my group on the target and that is how I was able to do so well within my classes and within any single leadership scenario that I am in that I was in and that I will be in.

So my leadership journey began when I was one of the child, so my family's up learning from great leaders of various kinds, so it would be that teachers, um coaches and sports teams, captains, the people I knew, well, Bosnian people I knew by reputation or even by singing on tv well, I think what I'd like to focus on really today is is my professional skills in that area and nothing from there. My, my actual grounding, my initial learning in leadership really came from having some very good managers and leaders early on in my career. So I was able to model my early, huge skills on there and what I found there was, I need to actually take a genuine interest in those people that you were leaving any task is ultimately every successful, if it managed well by people delivered by people. So to me, leadership is around managing people and and taking people with you on a journey. So in those early days my career is really a case of seeing the level of interest managers took in me and then other members of the team, making sure we were trained well and stretching in difficult objectives, but we were achieving these and where we were struggling, thank you sure that we were off the sport and then when I moved into a management role after a year or so, I re applied those lessons and I think that's something I've tried to do over The 20 years of my professional, correct. I think also one of the, one of the important things in leadership is not only being, being supportive and being positive for members of your team, but where necessary, actually having to be a little bit hard nosed and a little bit more a tough manager and that can be very difficult. And certainly I find I found it challenging, but ultimately the right thing to do and actually quite professionally rewarding. So I I actually managed a very difficult. Remember one team, we've had performance issues and attendance issues and manage that through the formal processes in my organization. To the point where despite my best efforts, he was not able to remain within the organization. And then I took that through too, to the point of a fair settlement that allowed the individual to leave the organization in terms that are fair to him as an individual, but also fair to the organization as a whole. And I was very, very aware of in that process was actually the need to be fair to and aware of the needs of other moments in the team who were put in the considerable extra pressure by the poor performance in the poor attendance of the one individual, so that's some of my professional background. But I think also I like most people have leadership skills that come in other areas as well. And one of mine is through mountaineering, so it's one of my one of my real and real passion to have some work and there are times in unique when I need to apply different, different leadership techniques in different situations, be that the very collegiate friendly encouraging model and so people are trying to get up a hill, go with that. There are times when if something is very, very urgent, very serious, I need to apply a much stronger sort of command and control model. So what what really mountain areas taught me as a leader is to adapt why style of my techniques to the situation, and that's something that I do out on the hill, but actually also in a work environment dependent on the particular situation, the time pressures and the complexity of the situation. Yes, in summary, my management and leadership skills have come about through over many years, many different situations and scenarios. I think that overall they've shown me to be a flexible and a well rounded leader and hopefully that's been a useful introduction to me, but I was very keen to discuss this in more detail.

And being a strong manager was kind of not an easy task at the beginning, but later on I realized that I have been chosen for that position As I was 1 1 of the sales assistant over there working that during that time and seeing my way of talking to people and the way I am dealing with problems and dealing with all the things that that's happening in the store. My manager felt that I am actually in the right position to be as a leader and that's how I became as a store manager. Well being as a store manager was kind of faint sticking for bigger name because you have to deal with a lot of things. The work load has increased dramatically dealing with a lot of people, especially in an organization with something around 15 people was so hot, okay, but I don't know as being a per leader, one of the main things that you need to have is actually communication and by having a stronger communication is being equal to everyone, treating everyone equal, knowing everyone's personal life and how they did when the workplace, knowing those things will actually help you a lot. It helped me a lot and being a proper leader because by knowing that I am able to solve their problems as well as being able to help them find solutions during conflicts. And that was one of the best things that I could find out because usually what I have seen and what I've been told when I was doing, my favorite book was I was the only guy who were able to solve problems as soon as possible while the older managers were not able to, because they used to keep on bringing it to the next day and dragging one problem for two or three days, it causes a huge scar in the person's life. And that's not a good thing to be frank. That was one of the reasons that I've had been as a store manager and the next thing to be as being a leader is accomplishing goals. Yeah, the main goals for us during the covid pandemic was to satisfy the customer as soon as possible to deal what they do and to make sure everything is going as small as I can because since it's the covid pandemic, we have to make sure everything goes properly. There have been shortages of supplies and things were going not proper and people used to struggle a lot and what I knew is by getting this proper role, I was able to get into doing a lot of forecasting all the number of contacts and I was doing absolutely wonderful in it. And by doing those, I was able to make sure a steady supply of supply in different kinds of goods has either been frozen, fast moving goods or even perishable goods as well. And on the contrary, I actually brought in a different strategy as well which will help a boost the whole morale in the community as well as and pro customer relations as well as boost of the sales. What I brought in was actually introducing home delivery, well it's been common for the rest of the stores, I'm pretty sure it is, but in other side, in other places there will be where our shop was situated, it was in that common and by bringing in, it helped boost a lot of people, especially elderly, with all those people. Used to struggle a lot just trying to get the paper in the morning and seeing those, it's kind of touched my heart a lot and I felt like by introducing it, it will help us a lot. So we actually started tying up with Uber where we started getting introducing the system which helped them to help people to others goods and services goods and services from Uber which the Uber people will come and start by taking it from us and we will be dealing with it to them and on the side rather than getting into Uber, we used to even sell tanks by recruiting younger kids who would be willing to cycle around the hotel just to deliver these girls by this critical thinking and the critical analyst IQ and problem solving these are things that the main manager needs to have and I believe I'm the perfect leader for that",POSITIVE,0.637,0.0312,0.3231,0.0087,769.0,LOW,1,99.0,2.0,Using only (2),8.35,0,1,0,"Master's degree (e.g. MA, MS, MEd)",Male,8.356925,8.092422,7.634909

I think that that's just a really important facet that you really kind of have to work out. Yeah. So I graduated from UC Berkeley as well And I worked in public relations for about three years working communications for multiple different different cities including the city of Los Angeles and Pasadena as well during the covid crisis and just helping get that initiative out are working with different teams to kind of help get that message out. Help push the pr about getting vaccinated kidding, okay, I'm staying clean and healthy just protecting the community around you. And um I also have a lot of experiences working both as manager and a worker. I feel like that's kind of, you know, an important balance that you kind of need to strike knowing um you know when you're you might be coming off too strong as a manager, I'm just kind of knowing how to understand um the people that you're working with and just understanding that everything is a team, everything has to function kind of together. Um I'm just really just helping keep that machine oil, I feel like that's my biggest strength really in that field. Um Additionally I feel like I really just personally have, you know, a passion for just communicating with people and working different teams with different people. Um I know one experience that I've had um was working for the covid crisis with the city of Pasadena and I think that that experience really kind of help build a lot of my leadership skills since, you know, it was a really um I guess you could say it was a crisis situation. Yeah, so it was really a lot of, I guess just kind of knowing when to speak up, knowing when to listen. Um no one went to work with other people um and also just went to work alone, I feel like just kind of having that experience, I'm just working in such tight deadlines honestly at the time it was, it was stressful deadlines as well, but I feel like just getting in touch with the team is kind of the most important thing there. Um I feel like my leadership skills, the way that I usually prefer to lead um is with a lot of listening and and just helping guide people into into feeling comfortable to share the ideas um that they have because I feel like, and most of the time a lot of people um you know, in the workplace come come with really good ideas um and really have a lot of a lot of good experience um from, you know, pass work and things like that that they can bring to the table. But I feel like the biggest barrier is often kind of that that comfort, that level of feeling like, you know, is my manager really just are they just a manager that your friend like trust them? Um Yeah, so I feel like that's kind of one thing I always really try to take into account, especially just been working with larger teams in more of leadership position. I'm just making people feel comfortable and making people feel value and like they have something something valuable to share if you like, It's just a really important part of that. And in fact that's one of my biggest strengths is that that's, you know, I always try to foster that type of environment.

I'm interested in the management position. You have, my background is in information technology management. I have managed projects and teams of up to 50 people to deliver and and install new software systems such as for payroll and timekeeping and financial management. But I would say the the skills I bring to the job are and attention to detail closure. I believe a lot enclosure that's making sure that things don't get dropped that if an action comes in it gets replied to, it gets followed up, you verify it's really happened and that you have the desired outcomes. Ah I'm ah I am able to work with many people have demonstrated, I can work across multiple units uh in groups of people at of from the bottom to the top of an organization. So you know, for these types of activities, you're really looking to see if a customer or if the internal company departments, you know what their needs are and try to address them. You have to show an understanding of what it is that their work environment is like and what their objectives are and how they need to accomplish activities within their units. Um it really doesn't pay to come in as the ah expert outsider and tell them what to do. Of course that's a recipe for not getting their buy in and not getting them to do their part to make efforts successful. I would say, you know, I have project management skills, I have people skills, I wouldn't say I'm charismatic but I think it's really the attention of detail and the ability to drive projects through that would make me access success, successful in leading a group or activity. I would say, for example, in one project for the national organization that I worked for, for example, I managed to get buy in from uh, the funder back in Washington D. C. As well as distributed work units across the agency to deliver, deliver a single sign on solution for a major federal agency. Uh the challenge really wasn't at the upper end on that project, but it was really working downward and getting people to want to implement something that was new and this is not just the end users. The end users was pretty esoteric and not really knowing what's going on in the background, but actually getting the technical side of the organization to move out and do something that was at the time, this was 10 years ago in action is more than that, but it was really quite innovative and was one of the first within the US federal government. So other things, I am like technology, I have an interest in technology actually, I'm very technically competent as far as it comes to knowledge of networking, ah and how you architect computer systems, how you architect network systems, how you plug software and data together to make integrated systems and also how you track the progress of multiple teams of people who are trying to do those things Now you hold regular meetings with them established key performance indicators to track what's happening, the indicators well, actually, you want records that establish your record actually, that you can then show people outside of your immediate group say this is what we set out to do. This is where we hit the mark. We demonstrated progress. That's very important to be able to represent that outside the work unit as well as to represent in simplified form the complexity of what the team is working on. So thank you.

At the end of the last financial year, I noticed that sales for a product, we're failing. I took the leap on calling a team meeting to address the issue. I suggest that you create a package of fields to offer customers, spoke quantities of the product for discounted prices. I scheduled weekly check ins with my co workers to assist sales and here in any concerns. Our customers were very receptive By the new year second quarter, not only had sales were covered, but profits for that product had risen by 15%. Our teachers were awarded by boosting our sales numbers which made us eager to improve for I took the initiative to organize a black tie gala in my college and successfully secured a venue and banned for reduced feet. I also oversaw a team of six other students who secured Raffle prizes from local businesses. The event was a success and we raised over 2000 for our chair. I previously also worked first of all retail company. At one point a coworker disagreed with the way I was handling customer complete after a discussion. We agreed that the customer satisfaction is paramount and that issuing a refund was the best solution. I'm sure the coworker that their concerns are valid and I appreciate their input. The customer is happy with the outcome and complimented our complaints procedure. So for me it's success is about going above and beyond expectations. My previous role as retail team. Later. My goal was to motivate my team to deliver impeccable customer service. I actively praised team members who went out of their way to assist customers. We had succeeded when several customers contacted head office specifically to complement our stores customer service. The most important value that I have is the leader is my integrity. I demonstrate honesty and trust in all of my actions. To establish credibility has been by having this conviction behind my words and actions, those who I need again are brought into the direction I take them again, commitment from my teams by influencing and persuading them to set specific objectives and will buy into the process. Once they have established cooperation and cohesion, they are on board to attain the call, A manager is able to handle tasks and responsibilities and ensure that others get their work done. A leader will inspire and motivate their team to achieve their goals. When I delegate duties to others that I know I can do better. However, if I don't delegate those duties then I could end up with more work than I can handle myself. I've taken courses in time management and learn how to effectively handle tasks to overcome to sweetness. I talked about the benefits of the idea during work and how to apply them. I also stayed open to other thoughts and changed my ideas in a way all my call records can agree when you gain from others who are much more successful in attaining goals than you would make it mandatory to follow procedure. Mhm. Now a time when I had trouble during a meeting was when we were gathered at the meeting, I would bring up praise to a team member of recognized success in front of the group so others could learn best practices. I feel that I work effectively in groups because while everyone has some unique quality they can bring to the group. We can also develop our interpersonal skills by helping those in the group who need it as well as learning from those who are successful. Yeah, I feel that I should read with teams once a week, at least on the set time and day after week. Communication among team members is critical and this will give the team an opportunity to get together on a regular basis and talk about the challenges and press conferences. Also, when our team reaches a milestone, a new project begins and award or promotion is given or when there is a challenging situation, I would want to bring the team together. Everyone will get the same message that way and we can celebrate successes or come together in challenging times. I find what motivates team members individually. So it is to speak to them about how a goal or change is going to benefit them. I make sure that I have direct amount of positive energy and constructive feedback to help them perform effectively. My actions always match my words. So when I speak to the team with conviction, they were on board with me and perform their best. So as a team leader, I am motivated by my keeps growth and achievement of their professional, personal goals and my best asset as a leader. And I believe it will help me for this management position.

I have proven myself over the last several years to be highly capable of working at management level, including can in favor with multiple stakeholders from across the organization of any level, including all the way up to ceo and the board and various senior leadership team members. This has been exemplified over the past several years by my leadership of a number of high profile projects um including recently the design build, launch, pilot and launch of a lessons learned log via the organizational learning technical working group and I was the one that spearheaded this project to success. Yeah, um and I did that by working in collaboration with a number of stakeholders um as I say, varying levels that included um project managing the entirety of the thing which included management capabilities such as delegation, um ensuring that I was demonstrating a high level of productivity myself to team members, a level of understanding various risks and contingencies. That meant that the project, you know, suffered some setbacks but by using the capabilities of our team members to the greatest effect, we were able to deliver the project ultimately on time under budget and a very, as I say, a very high level the project meant that we now have an organizational learning policy as well as the lessons learned policy and procedure, which is applicable across offices on a multinational scale. So there are now 55 offices across the world are using the lessons learned log that was produced, built and piloted, so there is an example of how I lead a project team um to success, we did have, as I say, some setbacks um there were times where we did not think that we would be able to complete within budget however, by using resources very craftily um and using everyone to the best of their abilities, we were able to do to to make the project a really large success and it's been mentioned in multiple organizational reports as well as this year's annual report. Um Additional capabilities that I hold apart from delegation of project management, generally our ability to be emotionally engaged with other team members, so ensuring that everyone is taking care of their own well being, especially in the last year and well more like two years now whereby we've been suffering in the context of covid. Um so it's meant that I have had to take on some additional responsibilities for team members when they've had time off sick or when they've just needed a mental health day addition. Additionally to that, I'm very attuned to my own mental health and again play the part of champion by ensuring that, you know, I'm taking care of myself, I'm not working beyond a reasonable amount of hours above our contracted hours and ensuring that everyone is open and honest about their own levels of work and so we'll continue to do this in a management position um and hopefully um That's it, I think, yeah.",POSITIVE,0.6997,0.0004,0.2995,0.0004,530.0,MED,9,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),6.39,0,1,0,"Master's degree (e.g. MA, MS, MEd)",Male,9.132759,8.853271,8.603708

Well, I think, you know, working in the theater industry as I have done over the last few years has really kind of given me a lot of abilities that kind of crossover to many different industries in many, many ways that people don't normally expect. So I think one of the exactly the easiest ones to kind of say is that I over the last few years I have developed a skill in making high pressure decisions and that which affect all the people, I've been able to stick with it because that's that is quite a tough leadership skill to be able to develop terms go, no, this is what we're gonna do, whether you like it or not to make those tough calls that no one else really wants to make and especially working in theater, one of the things that I found is it's such a tight deadline, so as I'm sure, you know, no matter what happens and that the show will go on at the time, it's going to go on if we're not ready, it's kind of tough. Look, there's an audience there, the curtain is going to end up at some point that we can't exactly say to people, you know, we're not quite ready. So sometimes you do have to make those calls and sometimes when things don't work out well or the set doesn't fit in the right place, being able to have that knowledge, um things I built over my own career of actually knowing the technical side of things, but also knowing what people can and can't do the skills of the team that I have as well as the knowledge of the team that come in and work with us and being able to mix them together and come up with active solutions and be the person who can make that good call. And so that's a really important skill that I kind of realized that I've learned in this industry and you know, I'd say as well on the top of that, I think as well knowing when to kind of take it above my head is another kind of silly 11 silly example I know full well that what is what's called the iron line in the theater, which is basically you've got the stage and you've got what's called the safety curtain, which used to call it an iron on iron curtain and obviously there's an imaginary mark on the ground, it's called the Iron line. The rules are always must be kept clear. Now I could quite easily say, well we can easily solve the solution and now we can not put, we can put something underneath, it will be fine, but quite often because I know it's well above my pay grade as it were going to risk that, I would quite often have to say no, I'm happy to do that, I can't see there being issue with it, but then being able to go to my manager or his manager and say it was available and go look we're going to we want to breach the iron line for a show it will be at this time this time this time or it may be permanently. Can we work around that please? Are you happy with it? I've been able to go to my manager with the right information and kind of go with knowing what they need and almost making a decision for them so they can have confidence in what I'm doing. Um Southwest on the big ones I thought obviously I have to be ultra organized as well. I've worked as a deputy stage managers and stage manager. Your entire life evolves and organizing other people and planning down almost to the milliseconds sometimes what other people are doing and making sure it's clear and concise and efficient. So when calling a show for example you have to know exactly when you're calling it to get the exact effect that you want. And also like even accommodate with your clue because sometimes you know that someone I always had a slight delay when they get off not setting off their cue. So you have to kind of accommodate them go back if I. Q. Is in effect to go slightly earlier so they're prepared. It might it works better and things like that. Um And again I think one of my personal biggest strengths is the is about personnel. I'm quite an empathic person and get on with a lot of people I'll happily chat. Anyone's heads off. But one thing that's really helped me out with one big skills and abilities that I've got has been able to see people being able to see kind of, you know, their strengths and their weaknesses and help develop them as well or even what their interests are. So it kind of felt to me often when I've been working in events, so people go, okay, I've got such a person here that have been in here before and I've been able to chat with them and go, okay, well why don't you try this and give them a few lessons on a piece of equipment? He now skilled. They are being able to push them further. It's been so rewarding to see people now who have kind of brought on who, I had no idea how to work in the theater in any kind of skill, now be running shows and developing what they're doing because they've had that knowledge and forethought and I've been able to just push them to develop that more or their interests more or help guide them in that right way and also being able to provide the right knowledge. Um, so that they can actually learn that whether training on a certain computer or a certain program or even just that this is what this kind of light doesn't want this light does anything like that. But finding exactly what their needs are, we have to provide, It has been a huge thing. You know, there's so much market going to, obviously budgeting rotate and not working on rotors. They're dealing with all those kind of things. Obviously every that margin does. But I think those things, things I described before really are what sets me apart as a leader.

When we completed group projects prior to moving online, we would work collaboratively in the university library, we would meet up at coffee shops to discuss the projects and see how we're all getting on.

I took a leading role in the greek project, in organizing all of our discussions and helping to create shared power points and shared documents, which we could all contribute to virtually this really enabled me to develop my leadership skills and take an active role in completing a group project to really high standard as I wanted to complete the group project to as high of a standard as it would have been had. We have been working collaboratively in person versus online as well as my university studies have really developed my leadership skills by completing my Gold Duke of Edinburgh Award. So the Duke of Edinburgh Award is something a lot of people complete during their secondary school in the United Kingdom, in which there is a physical aspect to the award, um a skill aspect of volunteering aspect and also an expedition. I believe this really allowed me to develop my leadership skills as for my physical aspect for the four years, progressing from bronze to silver to gold. I worked my way through the ranks of a men's basketball youth team up into the second team and up sequentially into the first team of the basketball team, um working my way through the team's really helped me develop my skills of getting to know people quickly and to be able to work collaboratively with collaboratively with them, a very fast pace, as I often didn't have a lot of time in each team, and so I needed to very quickly adapt and learn the new teammates, which what everyone's skill set were in order to best compete and win games alongside blame for the basketball side. I also began coaching the youth teams. This really developed my communication skills as I was working with Children of the ages from 8 to 12 When I was between the ages of 18 and 21, working with kids really helped me develop my communication skills is often I needed to explain things to them in different ways. Um And it really developed my patients as working where Children can often be challenging um as well during my Duke of Edinburgh award when we completed our expedition c which would be 5 to 6 day hikes um in foreign countries where we traveled to the south of France for one of our expeditions, This really helped develop my leadership skills as I organized the roots we took on the expeditions, which was very difficult, um and as such, I was the chief map reader for our expeditions, and so there was a lot of responsibility placed on me in order to successfully lead the team around the correct route in an unknown location.

Ah firstly, some of my experience, I have finished my degree in the country's best university in Syria and so I am highly trained in this field, I have been an intern in several multinational companies and have received both state and private scholarships. I am, I think I am creative skilled person with experience in my field and I am capable of handling a rather large projects for me, leadership not only means giving orders to other people, but rather being immersed in their project myself, I am rather lenient, but if some situation comes that needs it, I can be strong and make rules for others too closely and strictly follow ah I am only happy if my workers are happy, so I try to do my best for them to feel welcome in the workplace and their job and that they should not feel like their job is just a bad chore for them. Being a leader for me does not mean being higher than others, but rather being one of um I try to merge myself as much in their work as possible. For example, why I was in college, I have course provides a bachelor's thesis since the guiding teaches, the student wasn't that much younger than me, just a fear the few years difference, I was trying to be directed, especially uh not being too bossy and getting my nose high and as I mentioned previously when a situation came, I was more strict and have given him, but you would probably call orders. But I still listen to him if he thought differently than me of course, knowing his work was more important in that situation and much easier than in the industry since we were working closely together on that specialist project. But I think that just is the same. Uh I think I am a responsible person. I am fully aware of the responsibilities and the accountability coming with the job. I have several experience uh is with failure and mistakes unfortunately, but I took responsibility for each and all of them, whatever was the outcome. I even learned some things from my mistakes fortunately, even though I might seem rather shy or anxious right now, I can tell you I'm a good communicator. I can rapidly assess others communication habits and try to conform to them. I can give instructions clearly and concisely, but if someone asks, I can give a much more detailed instruction with explanations. Ah I also have some teaching experience from my college years and that gives me a lot of confidence in my communication skills with teams. And lastly I would like to tell you that I like to lead by personal experience and a personal example. I do not only tell my workers what to do, but rather show them first. For instance with the previously mentioned specialist student, I would not only tell him to buy something or to solder something they were working in the field of electronics, but rather go with him to the stores we usually frequented for the first time and showing him how to solve their different components effectively.

I've been a manager for over five years, have plenty of experience and in that time improving myself through various roles, I've done my results, speak for themselves and I finished last year, top of the year for most sales and highest percent to target across all copies. I'm very driven and I pride myself in wanting to not only succeed, but I want to be the best that I can be and in turn make sure I'm top of whatever I go for. I possess excellent time management skills, I'm very organized and I like to make sure that everything is done within the role, not only the role. I also like to look outside the role and how I can help other stakeholders within the company. I'm very creative at thinking I don't just follow, I also suggest and give explanations as to why things can be improved and hopefully help not just my role but the business as well. I'm very good at public speaking and delivering motivational messages. I think it's important in this role that you do do that. I think it's very important that you motivate your team on a daily on a weekly basis to ensure that they are motivated not only to work for themselves, but work for you as well. I believe my team work for me and want to do well for me, not just the company and I believe that leading by example is vital and everything you do, you must lead by example, if I'm not able to do it, how do I expect my colleagues to do it? I'm very good at presenting as well. If something needs presenting, I can speak to all types of stakeholders, whether they are quite low key or high up in the business and I pride myself in that fact as well and I like to learn as well, so when I'm in the role, not only do I want to be in the best I can at this role, I want to learn over roll so I can support other functions such as customer services or other functions within the business. I pride myself in great rapport building. I believe that I've got excellent rapport building within me and I believe that that's something that is really important to influence other stakeholders and manage upwards as well. As I said, I'm very, very, very self motivated, so it's important for me to be the best but also earn lots of money as well. Obviously why being a role, if you're not earning the most money you can do. Um So over the past five years, my previous roles, I've done the same role as what I'm applying for now, I've also been an area manager for a paint company, which was a very different role in that role, not only do I have to influence other people, but I had to include people from outside the business to buy into me and ultimately buy into the product have also been a store manager as a store manager, I had a lot of colleagues had to deal with HR processes, had to deal with time management with rotors, something which I can add value value into your business. And before that I was a showroom manager for B&Q. So in that role we were selling high end products, high kitchen, Â£30,000 plus, you know, this role, obviously the products are slightly cheaper, it's insurance, which we're selling. I've proven myself as well. So not only have I been a manager, I've actually been on the phone to myself and proven that I can actually sell as well. Again, it's really, really important because if you want buy in, you want to be able to coach others to do that. I pride myself in my coaching. I believe, I don't just tell the agents how to do things. I coach them on what good looks like. It's really important for me, not just to personally develop, but also personally develop my colleagues. So if I can personally develop my colleagues, being future managers, you know, future direction of the business, I am self satisfied as well and I'm very motivated not just to be in this role, but within your business, I'd like to go higher and higher and be the best I can be ultimately, and you know, the world's your oyster, why settle just for this role. I want to be able to be a future leader of the organization. And I thank you very, very much for your time. If you have any questions, please do let me know.

I delegate my responsibility in my absence. I need to delegate my responsibility because I want my my sobriety and my my junior staff to be able to to to to to to take up responsibility in my absence. And and and so much in that I always delegate my responsibility to my junior staff because I expect them to be able to pick up things in my absence and be able to do it. It's foster and encourage a form of development in them. Not because I'm the leader, not because I'm the supervisor, the need to put everything on myself and trying to do everything. I expect my junior staff, my subordinate to be able to like take up responsibility in maps and and also as a leader I listen to my subordinate. I listen to my junior stuff because I uh I expect to listen to them when they got worried. Sometimes you have worries a personal issue. They will have um development issues. They have their own health issues. So I always listen to them. I'm always willing to learn and I'm always listen to learn them a listening here because sometimes they may have their own situation. They're going through, it could be a personal thing, they could be on the job. it could be in the way their development, it could be their stories always willing to listen to them and I'm always willing to the time to support them and give them understanding and look, we're in this together. The fact that we work together, The fact that I am the supervisor doesn't mean you can't talk to me, I'm always ready to listen to them. And also when they are actually trying to criticize like from a feed back to the way I'm walking around them, I'm always willing to hear the freak by either positive or negative because he it helps us it helps us to be two to work together as a team, which is going to lead me to the next, which is gonna lead me to the next point as a team work. Uh The form of leaders in the form of uh part of my leadership skills is teamwork. Also I expect to be able to work with my team because I believe team works, I was to get to where we're going successfully, not just because I'm the supervisor, but when they're having their own issue, when they're having their own downtime, like as a team uh as a as a junior stuff, I should be able to like work with them as a uh as a team member, not just because the supervisor, I should be able to tell them that look we've got issue and the issue we've got here right now it's as a team because whatever they do uh whatever they do is they somebody as a as a junior staff will definitely impact what I do as a supervisor which that is very very key. And that is the reason why you need to work with them and that's the reason why I have to work with them as a team and make them understand that look when there is issue as a team, when there's an issue in the team when there's issue and uh when there's issue in in our deliverable as a downtime as a team as a team we need to be able to talk about it, we need to be able to go about it as a team so that we can create a solution and that will lead me to the next one which is I'm always willing to like create a solution problem solving problem solving precisely. So when there is issue I should be able to look think out of the box and think as a as a supervisor to make sure like if you come to me with the soul, you come to me as a problem, the should always have to rely on, they should they should always have that um um um That that that that that courage and that that mind that look when I go to my supervisor is always willing to create a solution to the problem we have is got a solution, it will know how to go about it and it will help me out basically.

A managerial point of view. I've got 25 years of experience of managing people um of understanding processes how to get the best out of people, understanding how to relate to people well on the professional front, but also combined a relational capability to to feel like there's a level of friendship that created rather than just a professional relationship. Um I have a wealth of experience in the industry. I've worked on behalf of people with multiple and complex needs for Um around 25 years. I've developed a multitude of partnerships in the industry. Um so I have a breadth of experience, not just in my own specific sector, utilizing football to support people with whole array of needs ranging from homelessness to mental health, to offending. Um so with this in mind, I feel that I'm primed for the position really, um through understanding a relatable person, um understand how to relate to people in order to encourage them to perform at their utmost. Um I tend to exude um trust, which means people give more than what you might expect from them on a basic level, from a contractual point of view, but understanding that when you're working with people in a caring industry, you may need to go over and above, and I model that first and foremost myself, so that I'm never asking anyone to do something that either I'm not prepared to do myself or I haven't already done myself understand the importance of you have been able to lead, but also being able to be an effective team player. So having been in that position myself and know how to encourage people in such roles from a managerial point of view and enable them to see how important their contribution is to the the greater cause. I think inspiring people is critically important as a manager, it's not an exercise to just process people or to just ensure that meeting certain outcomes and have it as a quite clinical relationship. I think it's important to be warm and I think that does bring the best out in people I think to have walked in the shoes of the people that you manage in first and foremost is a strength and I've done that so as much as my role is important as a manager, I think understanding what it's like on the ground level and how to perform the role on a basic functional sense is critical important. And so having an understanding awareness of that, having done it myself for a long time, I think I'll be able to get more out of the team that I am responsible for as a consequence. I love my job, all of working in this industry that tends to exude from me, I believe it should make every day count in class every day is a blessing and get everything from it that you possibly can and give to it, everything you possibly can to and I think with this type of passionate enthusiasm, demonstrated from the front that tends to encourage um a like minded approach from everyone else who might look to me as an example, or look to me um as an expectant demonstrator of what it means to work in our industry. Um I think the more people feel part of something important and part of a family encourages them to give more. Um and as a consequence generally find that people are happier, healthier, um off work less often, um and really do bring their best to the environment they're in. I think well being is critically important. So, so I think if we can embrace the person as a whole and recognize that they are more than a commodity, more than an employee of our company, but actually, um the more well they are doing in life more broadly, the better they're going to be doing in our environment. So I think it is important to take a genuine interest in people and what goes on in their life outside of work as well and try and consider them as a complete whole person.

I've applied for the post of manager and I'd like to tell you a little bit about myself and my experience. My name is Andy smith and I am an experienced manager. Having been a manager for over 30 years, this is enabled me to develop a good deal of leadership skills, knowledge and skills which I believe will be very useful to your organization. Now the poster I've applied for today is manager of the polling station. This is a role that I have dealt with many, many times and faced all kinds of difficulties issues and as well as a huge number of staff that I've had under my wing over the years. MR job I enjoy very much and I'm very much looking forward to working with you. Yes, the first thing about managing a polling station is that your staff are often not people that you work with before, so you meet them on the day for the first time. Therefore you have to gauge what their strengths and weaknesses are rather quickly. Additionally, the largest amount of work in a polling station is the setting up process in the morning. So what I do in order to achieve this is speak to all staff ahead of time, give them a clear idea what I want, what I want them to achieve, what I want them to do when I want them to be there when they can leave and what they can do in between. I also try and gain, create a bit of report when I'm talking to them on the phone. So I might ask them what their interests are. I might ask them where they see their career going and I might suggest that I might be able to help with that. So I will know that when I arrive to open up the polling station that they will already be there waiting for me and we will be ready to go. So that then brings me to the day itself. I go and open up the polling station with the relevant keys mm and I will have a quick two minute session with all the staff by which time should have arrived. Let's say one or two of the staff haven't arrived. We don't wait for them. We carry on and I will brief them when they arrived. Well of course also try and find out why they were late because that was one of the things that I didn't want to happen. I'll give them clear tasks, clear goals. I shall assign tasks and assign gold having already thought them through advanced and they will then hopefully set up the polling station as I require it Whilst this is carrying on. I shall go around the polling station checking for various health and safety issues as it is within my remit and make sure they're doing the job as I want to don't micromanage at this particular point. I will let them carry on if I need help. I will try and provide it either by myself or with another member of staff. Um but I don't watch over them closely, I'll have a quick go around at the end, view the work they've done and then see um if it's up to scratch, if I feel that things need to be attended to. I do say so straight away I say look that we do need to do this way, not that way or it needs to be set up this way and so on so forth. So then we will be ready for the opening. If you're always going smoothly, I'll make them all a drink at this time because I don't want them to um stop doing what they're doing. I need them to be ready for when the public come in and I will make them some coffee and tea in order to help that process. So with an open dealing with the public is difficult and I understand how that is so I can show a great deal of empathy to them throughout the day. I have a great deal of knowledge I have now experienced in the job so I can answer any queries they have that will give them confidence in me that I am both knowledgeable and supportive. I won't pick them up on every single thing. But if there is something that I do want to speak to them about, I'll do it casually at first, you know you mind just doing it this way or that way or don't say that will do, say that it's important. Hopefully that will be the beginning and end of the matter. I don't let it carry on if something more serious is occurring or the repeat issues, I will just ask if I can see them in private. I don't really believe in talking to staff in public about particular issues or or problems that they have in and that should lead to a really supportive, healthy working environment where they've enjoyed working with me and they'll be glad to I'm their manager. I will also be supporting to support them in developing their careers in in what we're doing. That is my presentation today. I hope it didn't come over to rushed as I say, I hope you'll consider me seriously for the position.

I I feel I'm confident in the job of becoming a manager and portraying my leadership qualities. So I have proven experience in this uh managed teams and both people before have lots of confidence, working with people and I'm able to manage people, provide guidance, provides support. I've been doing this for many, many years in the way educational experience, working in teams, working in on group projects together, taking control of the project's, taking initiative, for example, in university group projects where especially in this pandemic era, we have to work online. Yeah. And my team, we're very disconnected. We didn't really know what to do with it, really know each other. We couldn't even meet each other and therefore I was able to take initiative, send out an email, send out a team's group called with them, introduce ourselves and try to assign tasks to each other, explained to my other group members of what we need to do what the methods are, what is required for us, these sort of things. Mhm. Uh Home very natural to me. I've been doing it for a long time. Lots of experience with this, talking to people managing people and I'm very confident with that anomaly most the time I get very good results doing it. Um I just enjoy working with people in general. It's something um I'm passionate about, I love seeing people progress. I love being able to work in a team and all our team to get the credit and um recognition we all deserve through our hard work. Um I've got plenty of um people that I've known who also enjoyed working with me and that's not bragging, that's just you know uh me creating great relationships with people through managing being a leader. They've all enjoyed uh working with me working Mhm. Alongside me, you know, I always take into consideration what other people want, what they think. I'm definitely not someone who wants to take full control and definitely wanted um do what's best for the team and if that means compromising my own beliefs and opinions for the people's views which might actually be more beneficial, weighing up the options, what is good, what is bad? That is something I'm definitely willing to do. What's been successful for me, all my leadership roles, working with several people because you know, just giving me the essential experience needed to be an excellent manager, Managing people is something that just comes very naturally to me now. Um uh yeah, even in my jobs, any part time work I've done, working on a team, taking initiative whenever, you know, I don't feel comfortable with something or confident, I'll always ask with tech initiative or they ask other people, make sure they understand as well, especially for the group work project we're doing, try to reiterate what has been told of us. Um for example, as a student ambassador at my university, we often have to work in groups when working on together open days and open days are where parents, potential students can come see what the university is like. And I am basically a representative working with a group of representatives for my university. And often we have to organize these events and really beyond the ball with it and Nasa. And it's not necessarily that there's a leader. We are all the team, we are all friends. Well, you know, when things have to get done, I often, I'm willing to take initiative. I'm often willing to tell people what's the best way of working, how to get it done and obviously listen to them as well.

Um and some of those, I've taken up the position of a team leader, even on a temporary basis, um or someone else's away or just for sort of specific projects and so on. Um So during that time I've managed to showcase my abilities both to manage a team and to meet the expectations of the are required of us, but also to um develop everyone in the team and um sort of get the this sort of synergy and synchronicity that a lot of teamwork requires. So my sort of main incentive leadership skills would be an ability to sort of, to level with people um to sometimes take a firm hand when required, but often really just to sort of guide and sort of gently to have pushed people to was what needs to be done. So my sort of style isn't one that very sensitive, strict or rigorous, I describe it as sort of polite with them, but I'm also one of those types of leaders who likes to lead from the fund. So, for example, I mean, one of my previous roles um on a bar and, you know, a lot of the other sort of team leaders and stuff would sort of take a step back from the bar work and when they were leading the team and uh start doing other more managerial whiles I was very much one who would be sort of in the trenches with the rest of the team and really sort of and getting involved with everything that happens and the well doing that gives you the benefit of being able to really see what's what's happening. Um and seeing the sort of issues that arise, and that gives you a better understanding of what your team are going for. And also it gives you the ability to do that at some foresight, um to possibly avert some issues before they take place. Um So that's one benefit of that. Another benefit is that it sort of, helps develop a sense of camaraderie. Uh a lot of the more sort of old fashioned sort of leadership managerial styles involved, someone who would very much to place themselves, they rigidly above everyone else in the hierarchy and well, that does um makes sense in a sense for this organized, it can cause issues when it comes to and personal relationships with the team and really making sure that everyone is sort of working well together and is sort of kind together. So really by doing that, you sort of help stop that as well.

I'm starting my workstation at home and being interviewed for a manager's position and my place of work mm hmm. Mhm. I need to record the interview uh and upload a video of myself talking about the leadership skills and abilities, explaining why I'm the best candidate for a managing position. I believe I'm the best candidate because I've got 30 years experience as a manager in a particular. Failed. So based on that experience, I'd say that the uh the main requirements of a manager are the ability to new studies about prolific. And that itself is based on the need for a clear vision about what the organization is trying to achieve with a clear vision. You can plan to allocate people and money and other resources to achieving um the mission of the organization. All right, so planning is uh there's a basic requirement of the years, I've taken part in a number of projects to support the business mission and I believe I've got good planning abilities. Um it's going that usually achieving the mission involves uh multiple people, you don't often have to do something alone. And so another role for the manager is to um communicate the vision and the tasks to the people involved and and to motivate them to achieve those tasks. Um I find that my communication skills other than when I'm sat in front of a camera are generally quite good. Um I can engage with people and relate to them, make the tasks meaningful to them and that helps keep them motivated. Um Again, as a manager having having got a plan and got people engaged with it, uh there are often different options for achieving the objective and so problem solving is there's another skill and again I've got a structured approach to province to problem solving. I believe I'd like to understand what all the options are to evaluate them um in in a systematic and fact based way and to consult stakeholders to ensure that they would make the right decision, because at the end of the problem solving exercise you usually have to make a decision. Again, another ability of a manager um in addition to those sort of general management skills, you need technical ability as well in whatever field you're working. So as a scientist you need um the requisite scientific skills um both theoretical in the form of qualifications and again in practice. Okay, so um I'm now running out of things to say about the requirements of the management position that the skills and abilities needed. Um so I'm just watching the clock counting down 40 seconds And I need to keep this going for another 30 seconds in order to be paid for this study.

Um First of all just give you a bit of background. Um So then in the health and safety environment and quality um area for Pretty much Bang on 10 years now. Previous employer major construction company I was with for a total of seven years. The company that I'm now with now just over three. So just quickly than my qualifications and safety wise I've got my knee bosch which I passed with three distinctions. The environmental side I've got I. M. A. Environmental management and construction number. Quality side. I've got white I. S. 0. 9000 and 1 2015 lead auditor. So management for me then. So for instance if I break it down so proactively to prevent things happening um In terms of things like auditing the rest was good or bad. I've got years of experience audit team, all kinds of cruise, all kinds of jobs um In terms of management. So when when I have a good audit um it's praising the actual crew but sharing good practice so praise them for what they've done and saying there were a few minor niggles. So in the future I'd made to do this. And when it comes to about audits you have to be very calm and clear headed just basically go through with them what's gone wrong why it's non compliant or against the legislation it can be quite quite a tense atmosphere. So it's up to you just to kind of say that these are things that we found or sort it now but it will have to go down is this finding and it will have to do a little kind of you know investigation on it to raise measures then proactively obviously things like the close calls and near misses, reports of good practices and any kind of feedback so as to go through all of that and essentially praised Cruise. So the carrot and stick approach, you need to lead by example as a managing to recognize what people are doing things right. It's not just like, you know, um I think people are constantly, it should be rewarding them when they have done things right to install that culture and just go back to audits as well. So obviously we get audited by my clients and things like that. But many, many examples of where both good and bad, obviously the good ones are really easy. Just called it feed that back to the to the actual team that was doing that job in terms of the bad ones. It's to do with apologizing to the clark and saying yes, I understand exactly what you've said, gather some more information on it. It's apparent apparent relationships. So it's asking for more feedback and then giving them confidence. Once you've spoken to the groove, see what went wrong, it's not about pointing fingers, it's just about, we're a team, let's see what the underlying cause or the root cause resolve it in the future and then obviously make sure that the closure evidence is sent to that plant and that shows really competent contractor, which obviously is what we want to be because reputation is everything things can go wrong. It's how you do let you learn from it. And then on the reactive side, so from my health safety managers experience whether it's in investigating injuries either to our own personnel or two members of the public and also damages to property or underground services when we are digging or even environmental incidents. I've got years of experience of that. And again, it's just keeping a clear head, being very methodical. So you turn up on site, just gather all the evidence because you can't jump to conclusions until you've got every piece to feed into the actual story as to what happened. Even then Passion. Yes, humans are available. So it's a case of you did these things right? But unfortunately these things didn't go right and it's a case of who made those slight areas of judgment or mistakes. Again, it's about coaching and mentoring, not just about pointing fingers and saying you did this wrong or you should have done this.

You have to give them guidance on how they interact with the public, how they dressed their demeanor out and basically how to come across as a caring person. Some people are not suited for that.

Again, like I said, it's important to communicate well as a leader, you need to have good communication skills, so it's not just telling them communicating with them just a one way communication, communication is a two way approach and you need both parties, so I need to be listening to them and they need to be listening to myself. So he is a team effort at the end of there's no there's no me, there's no i in team it's an effort, it's a combined team and succeed in order to succeed, we obviously need everybody to play their part. Uh and she, you know, work together because that's at the end of the day, in this team team environment, how you're going to succeed, that everybody works together share the common goal and uh you know, has the confidence to basically bring up any concerns that they've got. Um So that's something that I would definitely be bringing to the table in this and, you know, that creates like positivity as well. Um and then basically helps them to concentrate on what they're doing and put their best efforts in.

And then if there is any sort of disagreement, because obviously in the team you are going to get there, is working with everybody to bring them back online and work together. Uh, obviously build that team left. So you have obviously events work related and all sorts of uh non work related as well. So, you know, if I can get their team to gel, it's very important. Um and I think you just got to give them the confidence and lead by example, I think is very important also, uh you know, often, you know, if you've done the job yourself, which I have done, been in this sort of in this field for nearly 10 years now. So I've obviously been gone through the chain and up the ladder myself from the phrase training position to senior manager now, which I am, that also makes a difference as well.

Firstly I have over 14 years of technical experience working in my projects where I have developed through the beginning to end cycle of technical drawings includes primarily electrical stuff as my background is an electro engineering and I've been Working with large groups in these projects and by large, I mean about 10 people. I'm one worker in it. However, due to my position in the team, I end up usually coordinating the work of several people. Mm As I said, I have 14 years total work experience at about 10 in my current job and I'll follow that up with the fact that I generally work in groups and prior to the pandemic, most of those were in person from time to time, usually every couple of weeks. However, since the pandemic, we've been working mainly remote um the projects we work on are generally Large scale technical drawings usually around 100 for the entire package. My responsibility being electrical, usually about half and I'm good at delegating the work while developing a plan. I do not have any um training specific training in project management. However, my job has lended itself towards those aspects. I usually end up delegating the work out to other groups and then we go through a review cycle when you develop the project the drawing and then work through it all the way to approval and implementation as I would lean followed back to my primary, the reason for believing I would be a good leader is my ability to take a large amount of work and then organize it and then delegated out appropriately with myself included. And then I also excelled because of my attention to detail a lot of times. The drawings of work on our cable drawings which have a lot of detail in them. And I have become pretty astute at finding relatively small small hers while also looking at the larger picture and realizing certain things might not you have to meet a deadline and how you organize yourself to meet that deadline is important. Lastly, I believe that my other strongest trait is my level headedness and overall ability to communicate and work with everyone. I I'm not an overly outgoing person. However, I enjoy working with people and being around people and I generally try to find what people are good at and allow them to excel at that without putting them in a position that they would fail it. So I try to put them in a position where they are can be their best selves for the reasons I've stated, I believe I would be a good candidate for this position.

Um To me a manager is making sure that you are leading other people in the right direction and working alongside them to be a manager does not mean you just stay in the office and don't do any of the actual work that the workers do it. I've experienced this firsthand when I used to work in, when I used to work in a warehouse when I wish I could go um and just being, you know, but on the barrel, you realize that the managers aren't really particularly on your side, so being a manager, being a good manager means to me is someone that is able to work alongside you. And I believe that that understanding is particularly what makes me unique, being someone who is confident able to figure out problems together with other people, um but also having the confidence to take on challenges yourself, is really what separates you from other people. So for example, I feel like my leadership skills for this um really come from when I did model United Nations in new york when I was at university, doing my Masters. Um this is just an extra curriculum sort of thing that I did alongside my studies. Um and I think that there I learned a lot about how about professional attitudes, how to work with other people professionally, how to lead your team in terms of having set goals. um and understanding what challenges you have in front of you. This was definitely probably one of the most intense experiences I've ever done. Um but in terms of actually what I've actually learned, it was really really valuable um but also in terms of having the confidence to figure out problems. I also um mm hmm did a Master's in political Economics as well. Um so I've spent the last six years of my life actually studying politics and Economics um and understanding the actual systems underpin um people and organizing people, I think understanding what these people are sort of trying to achieve and what they're trying to go they're interested in um is really important, so understanding your your workers um empathizing with your workers um and really being a barrier between the upper management et cetera, you you want your workers to feel like you're on their side. Um and I think from studying economics to a master's level, going to new york and actually being in the U. N. Has actually made me understand uh really how can we fight for what we believe in? Um fundamentally, I think being a manager is about fighting for your workers below you um and fighting in their best interests because a lot of them do not have the power to do so. Um so I think that's what's the most important for me um but also have experience in professional officers as well, I've done uh internships, I've worked for large multinational companies and I understand the processes that go on behind the scenes. Um It's a pretty highly qualified to be able to become a management position. I think what really sets me apart is my experience uh with other people um You know being someone who went to M. U. N. I think learning how to be with the people and talk to them, and I think that's really what sets me apart from other candidates especially. Um But yeah I think those are my support. I'm just speaking from my personal experiences what what good manager is um a lot of bad managers in my uh so I think I think that's what's really important to me, to someone who can empathize and understand um and fight in your best interests um which is absolutely what I dedicate myself to in a managerial position.

I was in the field of education and and kind of my background, I worked in a facility for um with adults and Children who had some conflict delays and at that point I was actually a supervisor of a unit with um these individuals had more severe behavior problems. So that's when I was first out of college, that's probably Almost 40 years ago. Um When I had that position and I was a supervisor there for seven years and my duties again partly was involved in hiring. Um I um was managing um on that unit. Um There was you know, different multiple supervisors, I would say three on the unit and the staff was probably 20 to 30 staff because some work part time, some full time. So that's where I had some experience. Um But I guess my style would be, I was because we were not about with healthcare and working with individuals, certain things you had to be so very um strict on like any type of abuse towards a like a resident. Um You just had to, they had to be dismissed. There was no grounds for that. There was also very strict just really in attendance or any other kind of thing being late for work. Again we were even though again it was a situation were often short staffed, but you had to be very firm for certain rules at the same point. I think I always worked well trying to train people realizing that when you hire someone, you know, you've got to invest the time to get them to be where you want them to be and if they don't have the support Um will likely fail. Um so I worked there for a few years and then I got became a school psychologist and I did that for 29 years. So in that in that experience I had to work with staff, I was very, in some ways very independent. So as far as those managerial skills, I again, I was involved with training staff to perform their duties involved special education, because we were involved, we were on a team that would do evaluations of students. So I often worked with regular education teachers, but also special ed teachers. So I had to do a lot of training with our procedures for doing evaluations as well as some of the technical things because we often use, I mean we do most of the work like online training staff to to use our system and making them familiar with the rules and regulations and that, you know, again, being in education, it was a lot of rules and regulations that had to be met and we had to consistently do it. So even though in that position I wasn't direct supervisor, um I did have a lot of experience with training staff and having to get them to realize that especially for newer staff, which again, you always expect them, there's definitely a learning curve that has to take place. So I did work with them. Um It's a most always successful we had to go, I could contact really their direct supervisor, but really in many ways it was my job, even though I wasn't, again technically a supervisor took to really to train them and make it go forward or only if there was a problem did I contact really my supervisor who was also their supervisor? Um And I said that was a rare, very rare event when that would occur. It was usually someone who had more than other issues than that and was struggling. Um But again, so as a manager of the department, all the experience I had, I often I was regularly appointed when my supervisor was absent, I was put in charge of the um of the special ed department which involved really district wide kind of again wasn't that frequent and you always hope no problems occurred, but if there was an issue certain things would come up and I was responsible for that. Um And I got that felt very natural to me having to be in a supervisor and really being um as a school psychologist, being independent um it kind of fit in. So I do feel I've already got a lot of experience. I I know what the job entails for the most part since I've done it partially, plus again, overall I've been involved with Special Education and the rules and regulations for really almost 40 years. Um, so I feel very confident that taking on this next level or next position would be a smooth transition. Um, I've also worked with all the principles really throughout the district, so I know what they need and I'm working with them and the staffing. Um, and I'm aware of all the the same type of problems they're dealing with. So, you know, students attendance, whether it's behavior issues, initiatives within the schools, I'm very familiar with all those and have been on multiple teams, um where I'm a member of those teams and people would look to me for.",NEUTRAL,0.2769,0.1744,0.5396,0.0091,877.0,MED,8,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),12.19,0,1,0,"Master's degree (e.g. MA, MS, MEd)",Male,9.355927,9.080918,9.060752

And another thing that is essential and important in a leader is creativity. I am creative in my own right and I believe that the great leader must be creative with everything that they do.

Uh another thing is that I believe in my ability to teach and mentor, a great leader must be able to teach and meant to others so that they follow India in the steps that they want them to fall because if one cannot teach, does not have the patience and love to teach, how can they lead one another thing. King building, I do believe that I have a great team building skills because a great leader must have a great team building skills to put up the teams together and get and get them working together.

Um I'm happy to be here. And first I want to start off by um describing some of my credentials and some of my experience over the past two years working in a job um as a research associate. Um So as some of you are aware I've had the opportunity to work with and mentor um and managed to some extent incoming students, incoming graduate students in particular. Um And during those two years I had the opportunity to um help them acclimate to the research environment. I've also had the opportunity to directly show them how to perform the different techniques that we that we do in the lab. Um And so that, you know, the different procedures we do for our for our research. And lastly I just I've had the opportunity to get to know them just as individuals. Um And and again just sort of help them um navigate the environment. And and for some of them, right, this is their first time um either for example being abroad or you know, some of the students are international and so some required a little bit more attention than others. Um And I think um I I did a pretty good job and that, you know, those students are direct evidence of my ability to work with different types of students. And also again just sort of help them get through at least the initial or early stages of scientific research. Um And so I think that's sort of my main credential for um for having the manager's position, but also just on sort of a more personal level in terms of personality. Um I feel that I'm very um levelheaded um And again I'm able to sort of listen to people very well. Um And and here the particular problem that they're having or difficulty and then figure out solutions um to help them solve their problems. And so I'm a very sort of people person. Um I like working with people, I like helping people. I like supporting people in their efforts to again become the best worker uh that that that they can be. Um And so I think for those reasons I'm also qualified for taking on the manager's position. And lastly I have an invested interest in seeing the lab flourish. Um And so we're currently in the process of writing and publishing some research papers. Um And I would love the opportunity to sort of overlook that process and and just make sure that things get done. Um And again, given my relationship with all of the students in the lab, I think I'm well suited to um sort of be the bridge or work with different students. And then of course our our boss or our manage our um supervisor to again help get things done, help facilitate um and and help, you know, the different students manifest their abilities which will directly translate into um you know, higher productivity and in turn the more journal articles and more papers um that again will showcase the talents of the lab and the very interesting research that we're that we're doing. Um And so again for those three reasons um having some experience already managing and mentoring students 1st 2nd just being a very sort of open and trusting and a very um um you know good people person and understanding people and working well with people and then second and then third having uh invested interest in seeing the lab, you know develop and grow and produce, you know competitive and and interesting interesting papers um that will showcase the talents in the lab. And so I think for those three reasons um I'm I'm well suited for the manager's position um And again I want to thank you for your consideration.

While I was, I also have professional experience with leadership, I was an officer at an all of my organization during undergrad, dedicated to yeah foster, you're closer to undergraduate communities in the community connections between students and alumni to encourage them not to give back. Ah we get to the tourists to support up and coming younger generations of undergraduate students for when they try to look for a job.

We have to, I I my leadership style, I act as mediator, so I always make sure that everyone's opinions are heard and I value unique perspectives that each team member brings and I tend to surround myself with people who I think are stronger than me in terms of technical proficiency or critical thinking because I know that there are personal biases that I that I ah possess that are harder to identify and can be detrimental to the direction of the project.

I remember being pulled into the principal's office. I was young elementary school and I remember I remember him sitting him down or sitting me down and rather than the typical lecture and calling my parents and detention and what I was used to and this was in regards to like another fight. I remember him saying, listen, if you, if you take what you have and you channel that into good things and if you choose to fight for good things and on behalf of people you can do a lot of good in your life. And remember that sitting with me one because I was so surprised that I wasn't in more trouble. But also that really for the first time that I can remember, there was another human that saw some sort of ability within me and believed in that to the place where they spoke that truth over me. And um, I won't say that like I never got in trouble again. And uh, and my life changed forever. But uh, I think that changed my trajectory for sure. And I began to understand that like the fire in my bones and, and that energy ah could be used both in positive ways and negative ways and the more that I kind of made my way through life and saw injustices and understood that part of my role as a friend and as a brother was to come alongside those who didn't necessarily have a voice and those who were experiencing hardships and those who um, understood that the status quo was inferior and unjust, the more I understood that it was I was on my end to begin to to do my part in changing that, so I think there was an understanding that there is some inherent leadership qualities and along the way. Yeah, I can't, I kept being found under these amazing mentors, like I had two coaches, athletic coaches in high school that um again I saw something in me and and brought me under their wing and and personally mentored me, put me in positions of leadership team. Captain councils um would bring me along too different speaking engagements within the community where um they would allow me to lead teams or they would allow me to to fundraise or they were allow me to to use my leadership gifts in different ways and and in very kind ways they would critique me. So even from a youth I was given opportunities to grow in leadership, but then also had these great mentors who understood leadership, military guys, um great leaders in their own right, who would say listen if if you give that message and you use these words you can turn some people off or if you if you have an understanding of where you want to go, but you don't if you don't have buy in from your team, you won't be as successful so that that really nurtured this aspect of my leadership that included things like collaboration. They include things like um waiting and listening, both um dissenting voices as well as as those who would have a shared vision. So um since then I've been able to enjoy some some great leadership positions and in the community, I would see my role as a dad as probably my most important leadership position.

Um, I have many years of experience having this kind of role within tens of varying sizes between far life and 12 individuals. one of the key aspects of project management and managing a team their own projects is to be able to set priorities for the members of the team to make it clear what their objectives are. So they understand what it is that they have to deliver as part of that privatization. It's important that I was the manager explained to the team why we're focusing on the top priorities, um, and that we align those with the needs of our customers so that we are going to deliver something that will be useful to the customers. And it's important that all of the team understand what those requirements of the customer are, and that's why it's our focus. A key aspect of management is managing resource. So within the team will be certain employees, team members who have skills and specializations in certain areas. Um, and it's important to align. Uh, those members of the team with the tasks within the project which are most relevant for which they have the most relevant skills. This is something which requires a A really good understanding on one hand of the abilities of the members of the team that I'm managing. And also the skills will be required in order to deliver on the projects that we're working on, and so that alignment is really important so as to make the most of the skills that are available. Another key aspect of managing a project team is to look at the pipeline of work which is coming in our direction so that we know what deliverables are not just in the coming few weeks, but also over the next month 2, 3, 4 months and all the way, really ideally up to a six month period so that we can plan around the resources that will be required. Another key aspect of managing the team. That's where we might have, uh, as it were, a conflict of priorities where the customers are expecting, Or possibly two more customers expecting delivery all of their projects in certain time. Friends where we don't have the resource in order to be able to meet those, and that will require a degree of negotiation. Um, led by myself as the manager of the 10 with the customers or the account managers for those customers to try to better line their expectations. And so it's about setting expectations around project time friends that we can deliver to, and I saw that we do not end up disappointing customers. They felt that they were going to get their projects delivered in a certain time frame, and we were not able to meet that because of a conflict in resource allocation. Another key aspect of the project project management are managing, projecting is training. So in order for the members of the team to feel as if they are able to contribute, they will work to have a sense of continual professional development. So it's important that help each of the members of the team to develop their skills in a way that there's both and beneficial to the team, but also beneficial to the employee. So if they have a particular interest in, uh, let's see, it's, uh, software development and using particular programming languages, Then if an opportunity arranges for them to, uh, participate in training program Approvals Technologies and then to try and facilitate that for them both in terms of making the time available, but also perhaps in negotiating some kind of availability overtrained budget to cover the costs of the course that they want to think.",POSITIVE,0.5242,0.0037,0.4643,0.0077,650.0,HIGH,15,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),8.860001,0,1,0,"Master's degree (e.g. MA, MS, MEd)",Male,8.823588,8.546696,8.308435

Um 1st of all when I was in grad school um I was in charge of a team of college writing instructors Um and I oversaw about four or 5 other teachers. Um We all taught colors, writing at the school, La Sierra University where we were studying for our graduate degree in english, so we taught freshman students um at the university and I was in charge of all of them. I worked um with the professors who were in charge of writing and in the english department. Um I helped shape um the curriculum and the syllabi and I oversaw the various assignments that we had. Um there were some instances of plagiarism where I had to coordinate between the students, the teachers, um the professors and the dean of the department and also the administration, so I have experience working on different levels. Um Furthermore, later in life, I was also a coordinator um in Korea at an english at a conversational english institute, We had about 15-16 students. I mean I'm sorry, 6 15-16 teachers, Um maybe 700 to 800 students. Um and as the coordinator of the foreign teachers, um I had to deal with overseeing their work and also um Relating to the native the Korean teachers, there were also about maybe 20 Korean teachers um and the manager of our hog want our institute, so I had to deal with both of them Later in life, I worked at a hotel um and I started as a just as a cleaner um at the bottom level and within about a year um I rose to second in command. I was um the head housekeeper's right hand, and then when she left I became the manager of the housekeeping ah Department for about two years. So I think in light of those three um working positions that I've had, which are first of all in charge of the college writing instructors at La Sierra University, and then later in charge of the foreign teachers um at the Sda Language Institute in Bhutan, and finally, as the head of the housekeeping department um at the Quality Inn in Wallawalla, I think that I have extensive experience, I think a total of maybe 7-8 years um of managerial experience. Um Then in addition to that for this position, I also have experience working on the first level as a teacher. Um Since this position is a managerial position related to overseeing teachers, I also have experience on the ground level. So not only do I have experience as a manager, but I also have experience as someone who has been a regular teacher. I think that's very important that someone who gets a leadership position also knows personally from personal experience what it's like um to work on that first level, it really helps you relate to the people that you're overseeing to understand where they're coming from, what their concerns are, what their challenges are. Um Yeah, so for these reasons, I think that I am highly qualified and that I am the best candidate for this position.

An example of that is recently working with an agile team that had a very difficult time in our transition process and had several different product owners and people coming through and I was dropped into this position with them. They had a very hard time anytime anything changed or anything was going on and what I learned and that is that nobody was listening to them. It wasn't they couldn't do the job or that they weren't willing to do the job but it was it was a position where they felt like they were thrown into a job and nobody really acknowledged what they're thinking was or what their capabilities were or how they felt about the whole thing, anything in our modern culture um and especially working with developers and competitive market, there's more to being a leader than telling people what to do. It's really about understanding people um and helping them be able to achieve the goals that there um that they want to achieve? I believe that people working in a position, do you want to have ownership? Do you want to feel responsible for the activities of work they provide and a good leader go and be able to understand what that is and help people understand the value that they're providing as well as give them the opportunities um to be able to be successful at that uh is a partnership in my opinion. Um Good leaders do not dictate uh and do not take credit for what other people have accomplished. A good leader helps to provide visibility to the team and the people that they're working with to be able to identify and hold up those successes and make sure that those are acknowledged, not with just within the team, but within the organization as a whole. This allows people to feel more ownership. Um and I know that's a buzzword, but it's true if you're not, if you don't feel emotionally connected to the work that you're doing, it's difficult to go that extra mile. And I think that if people do feel like what work they do matters that it's acknowledged um that I'll be successful. So my drive and what I have worked for over the last 20 years, working within technology is less about being a dictator and more about understanding and working with people and having them um provide the feedback, do the work and help me be more successful.

I worked for a long time in the railway and my expertise is unrivaled as opposed to have the candidates. I've worked in many different sectors of this industry. And with that I've gained so much experience which has helped me to develop into a strong and effective manager. And for example, I already have management experience of managing a team in my own department which is in human resources where I work in the rasta ring department, that management of several 100 staff for which I am responsible for. So that makes me a prime candidate for this role. Also like to add to that that have a unique and effective management leadership style which consists of being open, approachable and also very efficient and driven in my methods and I expect the same from my own staff.

That's sound logic, reasoning and spend a good amount of time collecting input from others. So then get to a final decision point which is fair and effective.

Um so I have limited but limited experience when it comes to actual leadership skills, because I've never led a team more than five people, but I've always had good feedback from people that have let um I think one of my strongest strengths, it all my strong my strength, my biggest strength is willingness to listen. A lot of people come up to me with good ideas at the time, and I was always open to hearing like a different point of view and not making any decisions without consulting them. And that often I think led to some quite good results because I was this is often in the context of leading programming projects, which often involves um various ways to approach a problem, including not just different architectures with different technologies as well, and some people might have experienced this is that I don't and a different way of looking at things and and and I found like the best way was to ask people what they thought and get feedback and I found that really good for look empowering people um and also when once I was certain about what needed to be achieved and how it should be achieved by laying out a clear sort of strategy, I think I was good at telling people like to just do that, that means they gave them a lot of autonomy and freedom to act in a way that they would like within as long as they achieve specific targets, which would then all come together and work and during this time I would usually monitor them and sort of be going from team to person to person and just making sure everyone's on the right track and making sure no one felt they were left behind or out of their depth. And I tried to foster local culture of honesty. So if somebody thinks they can do something that's fine, but if they laid to find out like it's beyond their abilities and that's also fine. Um the key is just to be honest with me and tell me that way I'll be able to change the plan to accommodate this, whether that be adding extra assistance or even just going a completely different direction. That's it's okay as long as they're honest with me and I'll be honest with them. Um what tells so when it comes to actually making the decision, I think I was good at that as well. Like I do listen to a lot of inputs but at the end it does come down to me to make the final call. And even though I will consult with anyone once I make the call, I expect everyone to follow that and I'm willing to take responsibility for that, whatever the outcome. And that also means like putting myself first and standing by my team. So I will always, I will never like criticize um anyone's one any one person for like the failure of the project instead I'll consider that my responsibility and anyone that I'm reporting to you will know that it is my responsibility rather than like a single person. There was there are no weak links in my team let's say except for me. And I think that's kind of important of being a leader is kind of to a certain extent protecting those under you and apart from like just purely like work related things. Also it came down to personal things like a few people told me some when I was training actually he told me um he had a bit of trouble with the police and it was up to me to decide what to do with that. Like I could have gone to HR and reported it um and he probably would have been fired and his duty was to make sure his Bosnia I knew and I decided not to escalate any further and to just seem see just let it go. Um And I think that he really that he really appreciated that because he gave me like the best work out of the whole team and he worked longer and harder than everyone else and I think he really wanted to prove himself. And so yeah that's it. I think where time is almost up now so I'll just stop there and I hope that helps",POSITIVE,0.7759,0.0051,0.2147,0.0042,748.0,HIGH,14,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),8.35,0,1,0,"Master's degree (e.g. MA, MS, MEd)",Male,9.003387,8.727103,8.805557

Uh Covid has been quite a bit of a challenge for us. Uh huh, luckily we were already using lots of different PPE um face masks, hair and that's I don't think that would really help for for Covid, you know, but we already had all kinds of, you know, hand washing it. It was already um it's something you do every time you walk into the production floor, you wash your hands. So that was something we already had in place. It was helpful. We have had six shutdowns, There's a lot of people in our plant, they tend to kind of work in close proximity um that we we may very well have more um we were providing paid sick time off, anybody felt sick or if anybody had a positive test Quarantine for 14 days, they got paid for it.

Um I've developed my leadership skills and numerous different roles, one being on film sets. I've worked on a lot of film sets and that is a very, when you work on a film for here is very like hierarchical so like having a leader there is okay um for making you know the project game and this is like it is like a lot of key challenges and making videos as like for example there's like deadlines but there's like multiple deadlines, there will be a deadline for the whole project and then there'll be a deadline for each individual shoot day and like you know if you're doing multiple seeds you have to make sure you hit them deadlines. So the first sort of thing I think it's important is time management um particularly I've been in a leadership or what I've been directing issue, I have to ensure that everyone is um on board with the shoot and that everyone is doing a test and that means you have to have a sort of like a knowledge of each individual role. So you need to know a bit about sound sort of bit about camera work um which is looking if I specialize in cameras. So I have to understand as the rules like you know sound, I don't know as much as that so I need to have a basic knowledge of that so I can communicate so I can get shoots done on time and that's that's the thing like on the day when you're leading you have to be and you have to be responsible for the whole project so someone else in your teams um not with it then you have to motivate them. So yeah I feel like being on films that has really developed my leadership skills um also working in different job work environments has as well uh huh particularly like the catering industry when I worked in a kitchen, it's sort of like you can get very overwhelmed with with with what you know that might work going on. So you still have always got to keep a good attitude, you know sort of like smile, make sure better if you're leading team is better. I find spare not simone with them, you sort of like to say look we can get through this together so of being like you know optimistic about everything. And I think that's the main thing is having optimism about about your team and having like vision. So when people like forget why you're doing like a project, say to the video project, but I do a lot of um it's sort of like use you can reassure them that you know there's a vision and and you generally get a better performance out of people um Yeah, yeah, I think I think that there are three things I think having good vision and being able to describe that vision, you know convincing me it's very important for Lesia and I think I don't have more some film set because you're working a very creative project, there's a You know, you sort of have to remind people why they're working a 12 hour Our day or 10 hours a day on a shoe. It's for this overall vision. Um then I think it's communication and I think my money fingers, I always try and at least learn, learn like something about what someone else's role is. So you can communicate with them about that, so you can actually understand if they have a problem and help them find a solution, but it's not, it's sort of like because if you they come up with a problem and you don't have any idea what they're talking about, why it's taken then so long as I certainly do sound, then you know, it's sort of like you can't help them. So I think as a leader, you need to take initiative two, learn about everyone else, the team learn about them as a person, also learn about what they're doing of the job. So you can best help them and sort of like trying to help them understand what you do as a job and who you are and what you can do to help. And I think that's all comes down to communication being open minded and just helping people. So yeah, yeah, I think that's the main thing about leading, it's yeah, just communication confidence, you know, attitude in the past, I've been on long shoots and, you know, like a lot of people are getting tired and you know, you just sort of got to keep a positive because the bathroom on top is feeling bad, then that's gonna tunnel down and everyone's gonna feel bad.

I think I could do a good job as a manager of this section. I've already been doing the job for 30 years as a quantity surveyor, I've managed small teams of three and 4 people on individual projects as ever with the construction, some go very smoothly, some go very not smoothly. You have problems with contractors, you have problems with the other designers. Uh So there's inevitably problems. The good manager is the one that deals with those problems and decides the way forward and gets the project completed as close to the original deadline and as close to the original budget as possible. You need to have been working on some of the more difficult jobs and the more troublesome jobs to understand how they go wrong, why they go wrong and what you need to do to resolve them. In recent examples, we've had contractors who get very aggressive and contractual as soon as the money doesn't quite get to their account as fast as they were expecting, you have to be very tough and very contract reminded yourself to explain to them why the money they're getting in isn't quite as much as they thought it was and which contractual terms you're using to save the money isn't coming to them just yet. That needs a lot of knowledge. It needs a lot of management skill. We often find our younger surveyors are quite persuaded by the contractor to pay more than they should be. They need help in terms of the management role, want to be checking what they're doing to to give them a little bit more confidence to say no. So the contractor and give them the ammunition as to why they say no to the contractor. If you've got a team of young surveyors paying contractors every month, you need good management to make sure those payments don't get overpaid, Don't put the client's position in Jeopardy. After 30 years, I've got all of those skills and I feel like it's certainly manage a team of 10 or 15 surveyors keep them on straight and narrow with close supervision and making sure our firm's position is protected, Our client's position is protected and we have enough staff to cover all eventualities on the more positive side. I've been through all the graduate professional qualifications, a fellow of the institute, I mean, so the staff working under me could see the path from their position as a junior surveyor right through to the senior or the manager and severe and I think that's a good incentive for them to be able to see in five years or 10 years or however long it takes them they can get from their junior role to a senior level if that's what they want. And you can see that there's a possibility within the firm, there's someone for them to aim at And after 10 years, 15 years in the same firm, they could be in the same role while I was starting out, that was a good role model to aim for my old boss did the same sort of process. I'd be encouraged if some of my junior staff could make it through from the junior levels right to the top and I would be active and positive in helping them get their obviously some staff that doesn't appeal or they are much more short term minded, that's fair enough. Out of half a dozen, you'd expect one or two to be, climb in the Christi paul a little bit, Maybe one out of 10 or 15 might have the ambition to be the managing severe, I think I could bring all those stuff through and get them to the the level that suits their ability and ambition. I think that would be an ideal management structure if they can see someone in the firm has been on the path that they're aiming to follow. I think that's what it, one of the thing as a manager, I do like a good team bonding a pub session, meal out team activities just to show it's not all work. I think in the current climate, that's probably an important backup to all the hard work. You've got to have a bit of downtime and show the team that you can relax and going up with the younger members of the team, it's usually good fun.

And I first think I showed this in a group project during university. We were designing U A. V. And we have to make a number of key design decisions as a team. I was the leader in this situation, so I had to make the ultimate ultimate decision as to which I actually went through. Um Furthermore to this. I've also done a project on my own as part of a dissertation and that was entirely down to me to make all the decisions, all the key decisions that were required to this was to create the experiment and then to decide how I was taking the results down. So another key metric I believe is um communication and obviously as a leader you need to be able to communicate effectively with people you're leading. And the examples of me showing this again, as I mentioned, I was team leader as part of the group during my degree and I believe that I was an effective communicator. Um I spoke to team members to get advice um to get their ideas and we held regular meetings in which notes are all taken down um and then these notes, these notes were uploaded so that the rest of the team could then um look at them, The next one is delegation. Um I think the ability to delegate um is something that is definitely overlook as a team. Um Manager, I believe I've shown this, it's important to be able to to recognize when, when it's important for you to step down when and give it to someone who might have more expertise. Example of this is in a project again at university in which we were working as a team and I got to delegate the task that I was working on to it to another team member simply because they were far more skilled in that particular area, even though I wanted to be able to do it, but I had to recognize in that moment I wasn't the right person for the job, all these sort of linked together into general general teamwork. Teamwork is also very important, being able to work as a team, think of showing this in situations, I've played sports for a good portion of my life and so that obviously includes teamwork and also linking back to the communication side of things, playing in a zone zonal defense for example requires a lot communication and good teamwork, um adaptability. Uh I think I'm an adaptable person, I think it's important to be able to that two different environments, two different challenges and to take them as they come. Um And I think I have shown shown this, I think I've shown through university my ability to adapt from module to module, you're doing eight modules a year over a 3-4 year course. Um Not only that you're doing individual projects, group projects, different number of people in projects. I think I've been able to adapt to all of those situations quite effectively. Um Another one tech savviness, I've grown up around technology, I have a great deal of experience within a number of different software packages. I believe this is important um effective with your various Microsoft word, um other Microsoft products.

So ever since a very young age, I have been a natural leader in school and um I was the head boy in primary school and in high school and so I just have the natural urge to lead people and I do believe that I've also been graced with the people skills as well because I do believe that a very important aspect in leadership is having people skills and knowing how to treat people with respect as well, which is um an area that I think that a lot of leaders really lacking is because they tend to have a more dominant stance and the more um autocratic stance and and and my leadership is a very democratic leadership style which I do believe is the perfect balance of leniency and strictness and and I believe that it is very effective in bringing out the efficiency in in in people's work. And so um I do believe that it's very important to to maintain a level of personal respect for every single person um before before looking at them as as as a worker that you were leading, you just need to look at them as just people and just really respect them, respect their feelings and respect who they are and I do believe that that is the foundation and the the very most important um aspect of leadership is that once you have that respect, then you can build upon that foundation and and then you can gain their respect as well and um as a result you can manage them or lead them in an effective way. And so as I mentioned before, I have a democratic style of leadership and so what this really includes is is just making sure that everybody feels like they are a part of the team and it feels like they are part of the decision making process, This is very important in motivating the worker and and getting the best results and so it's it's so important to to make the worker feel that they are needed to make the workers feel that they are a part of the team and so this is what will bring out the best in them, this is what will make them want to push further and further um and and push themselves to the limit really is when they feel that they can actually make a difference. And so this is the power of democratic leadership, is that it will get the idea um in the mind of the worker, that they are needed and that without their work and without their cooperation, that there could be uh immense repercussions, and so that will give them self motivation to do their best, their very best to give their all um for for the organization and so that's that's the key and that's um what I believe is the most important aspect of leadership is just getting that specific part right. And so um I have experience in different areas of my life right from when I was a child in primary school and in high school I was the head boy and when I got into university um I was one of the student leaders as well. And so I have been really doing this for quite a long time despite my very young age. And so I do understand the dynamics of working with people as well as getting the balance of leniency and strictness as mentioned before, because that is something that is extremely, extremely important and we all need to make sure as leaders that we do not push um people to the limit, we do not make them feel um any negative um feelings towards us, but but there should be a level of respect that goes both ways that would make them um feel motivated to follow instructions to go in the direction that you were telling them to go.

Um So I feel that I'm the best candidate for the managing position based on my previous experience.

And and on the back of that I've used that experience and in my daily work to manage different groups of people. And this ranges from you know, different members of the team. Um And with what I do as a health care professional involves managing nurses, um administrators, secretaries and so forth. Um So alongside I've also attended and assertiveness and skills program to develop skills that would be relevant alongside managing and sort of leading a team as well and and along with that comes the importance of managing time. So I've also attended um uh seven habits of highly effective people program and this was written by an author who had experience um using his time effectively to achieve meaningful outcomes. Um And so that's what I have used to try and develop these skills and my line of work is quite busy, so you would involve managing various different people at different times. Um And quite often you would um gain lots of experience and I've had these over 10 years have experienced during this um And based on that I feel that that would make me his film and candidate for the managing position.

So um yeah I have had experience as well working across different sites um instead of being aware of how different organizational structures work. And we also have a good cohesive team which allows us to establish the reports between not just health care professionals, but also he manages as well. And because ultimately asked to watch, you know, team means, you know, together everyone achieves more. Um So it's important to then how much balance working with health care professionals and also manages within the team and me. Yeah, so overall the experiences along the way have certainly built confidence and um doing the job right. I think alongside that, like I said, there are the personality traits that would come along with managing team. And so in addition to time management, it is important to you which you prioritize your job list or job structure.

I'm really excited to interview and I think there's like three main areas that I would love to highlight. That makes me ideal candidate for this management position. Those areas are my background and education experiences that I've pursued. And third my ability to galvanize people and achieve. If you look at education, I have spent a large amount of time gathering formal education and ideas that propel and help me understand different approaches beyond my bachelor's degree of pursued graduate studies in leadership and training. That combination was amazing because it talked to us, some of those core philosophies are on leadership, but it moved it into the realm of how do we train, how do we promote those ideas and build them in people? This has given me a unique capacity to look at different styles of leadership, understanding teams, understanding human dynamics, understanding motivation and yet also being able to look at how do we train and build on other people? What are the characteristics of that all learning. In addition to my Master's degree in leadership and Training, I've pursued other degrees, I've gone forward and looked at the area of human resources and gone to university, become Certified in human resources. This only built on my previous management and leadership training and then it added all the other dynamics and dimensions of how do we lead people? What are the areas of recruitment, selection had built upon the training and development which is so overlooked in human resources. It added in law and contracts and the ability to performance evaluations, not just for checking the box, but for being able to propel people to be better on top of that? I looked at different areas on how do we create flow? How do we manage all these processes that training the leadership that developed? How do we manage whatever project comes to us? And I went and got trained and certified in project management. That project management has been valuable is it teaches me how to map of scope and sequence. It has allowed me to look at development both of people development. Project development. And how do we map out and achieve the goals of the the organization. That's the formal education. You can't separate that from the informal education that comes through great mentors and the experience. I've been lucky to work in different fields with some amazing people. I've worked in public education for a large number of years. I've moved over into nonprofit management. I've worked in government and policy. I've worked in um investigations within the government and human resources. I worked in recruiting for a large um private college and I worked in senior executive leadership for an entire region of schools. Those different experiences allow me to learn from different mentors to learn from great people to go out and seek those different people. I've been able to bring that back and those skills back to what I do. I guess that's the third thing if I'm asked, what do I do if you were to go to the people I lied and have led and said, hey, when you look at James, what are the things he was able to do? I think I'd be really proud of a couple of things. One was able to recognize them where they're at. That's that leadership style that filters who I believe that leadership is about meeting people where they're at and providing the skills, the training, the opportunity, the vision of letting them be greater than what they're capable of beyond accountability. There's just that deep understanding that people are capable when we create the circumstances for them to excel. That's a leadership style. It's a leadership style based on values. It's based on seeing people in recognizing their strengths, overlooking any challenges and weaknesses, providing the training that they need and giving them clear line of sight to how they can be their best. It's not about trapping them or tricking them or finding fault, It's about pulling out of them what they're capable of doing. And if you talk to the people I lied, I think that's what they would say. That's a James has this unique ability to connect with me. James has this unique ability to see my strengths, highlight them to provide ways in which I can benefit myself and the team, ways in which I can learn and grow and when I focus on those people, when I focus",POSITIVE,0.9962,0.0001,0.0036,0.0001,766.0,MED,10,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),25.35,0,1,0,"Master's degree (e.g. MA, MS, MEd)",Male,9.005702,8.727282,8.495542

Um That will involve a certain amount of planning, getting the right people doing the right things at the right time and making sure that the right people are in at the correct time. Um I'd also have to settle any little disputes. For example, if someone's not happy or there's arguments between them, I'll generally be the one that gets in there and sort it out. For example the other day, one of my large wayne, he was not happy about another another of the last time and he was talking to him. Um he had a bit of a, had a bit of a strap, so I just had to get in there, get them both together, calm them down, make sure from then on they are acting, we have a bit more respect for each other to keep everyone, keep everyone calm other than that.

I'll allocate that to a different person each day, so not everyone is doing the same thing every day because I find them if I give everyone the same thing to do every day, someone tends to get bored, someone tends to moan, someone tends to be jealous of what someone else is doing.

I think it's very, very important to lead in a way where you don't, you're not seen as someone who just constantly tells the, tells them exactly what to do because that's not gonna help in the future. It might help right now.

Um Well, it is the real job interview. I talk about my CV and my track record and I won't go into details in this pretend situation, but I do have some years of management experience both in my current role, about three years and that a previous role in a previous institution where I held a variety of both informal and formal loan management responsibilities. In that previous role, I ended up running a team of three people. I grew into a team of five people and I think we did very well that role involved bidding for internal funds within the organization. So we had to make a business case for why we could deliver against those funds and then recruiting and managing a team. And I recruited a very high performing team and manage them through what I like to think of as an inclusive and friendly personal leadership style. So I was involved in the creation of the content that team was making directly involved. So there's a degree of credibility or leadership by example and in the sector. I mean, I like to think that's important. There can be a degree of difficulty managing an area that you have no personal experience of where you lack a degree of credibility in the wrong. So one principle for me has been not to try to manage outside my sphere of personal competence and that becomes difficult to hire Apple organization you go, but it is possible to form an acquaintance and maintain a currency in the area in which the business operates. I think that's important so that the people who are leading to see that, you know what you're talking about. I have some personal experience of the tasks or the challenges or the goals that they themselves are set. It becomes a point in management where one can't be directly involved in everything. You have to delegate and trust your delegate and trust your team to get on with it. But a nodding acquaintance or better than that of profound acquaintance with the area of work under consideration. I think it's important. So that was one principle of leadership in that role when I tried to carry that forward into my current role as well. Um another area of leadership that I've thought about is the management of people and generally I think that leading a friendly and as far as possible, the democratic way, it has to be my start. Now you have to set goals and you have to measure people's performance against those goals. A regular performance appraisal of course is a standard thing in most sectors, including in mind. So you do the Eastern Annual Performance Review. But with informal cap shops in between that including, hold team meetings and individual meetings where you can ask individuals what's on their mind what they're working on at the moment, what's going well where they need some more support, I'd like to ask people if they have particular training or development needs that we can try to fulfill because that's a good way of keeping people skills current and also showing that the businesses that we're investing in them um on occasion one has to deal with difficult situations with a set, for example tasks you think can't be met with the allocated resource or you have to prioritize between different high priority tasks. Like many organizations, we had that under co victor considerable degree and you make decisions often under pressure of time, choosing between imperfect options with imperfect information. And I think if you do that in a way that demonstrates gun sensuousness and integrity and you communicate up and down the train in the building, so you listen very hard to what your own managers are saying. The leaders of the organization you listen, I think very hard to get your stuff is saying because they're on the front line often and they will be dealing with as it might be a customers or users of the business and they will have direct understanding of what's going on at the coalface, shall we say. And between those two, you can triangulate and take a position that you think is the the right one for the needs of the organization at the time and I think all of us in whatever professionally working were tested under the lockdown conditions of last year, we had people pivoting to work from home.

I have a young family, some people found they missed the camaraderie or the productivity of the office of the people felt differently, you know, a range of opinions and we now have to manage the return to work. And I think one of the things that showed us was that if you trust people to get on with the work in their own way, actually, they often will always in the cases I was working with. So we've tried to hold on to some of that, the degree of finding a consensus on a difficult situation actually. I think the service quite well. So there's a piece of recent experience. If this was a job into you and you said, can you show me an example of when also your leadership style according to the pressure of events. For example, there we go. Covid is a good example for all of us. Um, so to sum up whatever I said, trying to lead with authenticity and credibility, be kind be nice.

Yeah, I believe my leadership skills are um how to explain them. My leadership skills and my abilities are quite varied. They are built upon a variety of experience skills. This is across various industries. I started my career in retail. Um Slowly building up from storeroom stockroom assistance to shop floor shop floor supervisors. Even at a young age I enjoyed communication, communicating with various demographics of people um different situations. I quite liked leading a team as I started to get older. Um Mhm. People of my, especially I think in retail you were finding it was people closer to my own age group, some older people, but generally it was um developing leadership skills of people of my same peer group as I got older. Again built on those same leadership skills I developed and honed in the retail sector. I moved into warehousing. Um Well actually I asked Jump to step that actually moved into security first from retail. Um that gave me a really good foundation in terms of developing my leadership skills because as a 22 year old control room operator, I was um directly sort of line managing and sending commands and operational procedural orders too, security guards, security managers which were substantially order, sometimes substantially older, sometimes people ex special forces. Um So to engage with people from these backgrounds, especially as a younger person who hasn't had experience in these backgrounds, it was challenging, but was brilliant. It gave you an understanding and an overview of how to speak to people off older and more experienced backgrounds, how to get their respect, how to keep their respect and how to ensure that they carried out the instructions you had requested of them really, I found very similar methods I would employ, whether it was a team of three or whether it was a team of 15 or 20, I haven't had direct experience with more than I'd say 40 now and now I work in health care. So I indirectly line manage around 50 staff at the moment. This brings its own challenges. It's you find yourself not being able to be as hands on as you are with the smaller groups. Therefore I think you're having to trust in your team a bit more. You're having to trust that what you ask the KPI is you ask people to be aware of the compliance is that you ask people to maintain. Um becomes I think there's a lot more trust involved in being a leader and I think that's a massive part of leadership abilities and skills is trust, trust in your team. Obviously trust. Um he's usually developed and and earn over a course of time. But as a leader with the team, you don't always have that luxury. So sometimes you need to bestow trust without the prior experience or the prior foundation in terms of having people having earned it and you give people a chance to lose your trust. Um Which sounds quite cynical, it's not that you want people to ideally you want to give 20 people your trust and those 20 people will continue to earn to earn the right to keep that trust. Um However, you know, I think the trust really sort of the emphasis on the trust being so important is also because as a leader it's very easy to micromanagement over micromanager staff and that's not a good leader, that's um the inability to lead, that's that becomes quite an independent role. And I've had I've experienced it myself into the into I I experienced it to a degree now with my upper management, so having been able to employ trust, being able to employ the real abilities and skills are, leader shows will as a byproduct mitigate how much you micromanage and as a byproduct of that really improve. I believe your leadership skills, abilities and the potential that you have that your team has and the potential you have to take your team even further.

Hi, my name is ed and I have been a healthcare manager for more than 30 years. Um I have a master's degree and in science and I also have a certificate in health management, I've had various leadership roles in Um in management for over 30 years, most of them at the at the same facility. But with a variety of roles, I have extensive experience in budgets um and uh various management roles that I've had. I've looked after departments of greater than 100 staff myself. I've also had leadership roles. Where I've had been responsible for a number of departments with approximately 300 staff members. Um Some of the different areas that I've looked after included allied health services. I've also looked after mental health. I've also looked after geriatrics, uh emergency program, family medicine program. So a variety of different health care programs within the hospital sectors. Got lots of experience in hiring, performance management. Um As I said previously budgets, operational planning. In fact for the organization. I for the last number of years have been the um operations chief on our our disaster program for the organization. So responsible for planning for a variety of disasters, including floods, pandemics, uh fires, all the contingency planning that we needed to have in place for a variety of different disasters that we've been facing. Obviously the last couple of years, the biggest one now has been um covid 19 did a lot of the planning for where is our capacity? How do we expand bed base if needed to deal with the ever increasing number of people showing up in emergency that are sick with this very uh serious illness. So um those that some of the areas that I've had extensive experience with in the last year, one of the other major projects that I was involved with was moving of several of our ambulatory programs from being hospital based to being offsite into the community um in deciding which programs could operate there and how that would be done given that there's still a strong link with the hospital. How do we move services off site and still provide them adequately in the last year? That is also expanded into doing more home service for people that because of the pandemic, can't come to the hospital for services for for outpatient services. How do we provide service to them? So that whether that included um compute different computer models and different uh a way to provide care than what we typically had done. So, those are some of the recent examples of areas that I've been involved in. Um the move to the community was a major one where we moved um complete programs, complete the staff and the logistics of just trying to arrange the equipment, um personnel dealing with the unions and dealing with who could move, how we make this move happen, how we continue to have the hospital send supplies over how we get the health records back and forth. These were all part of that major project and this was all taking place just as we're also trying to do some planning for the upcoming pandemic. Um And so I've had the multitask that way. I'm very experienced with juggling a lot of departments, a lot of responsibilities uh and a lot of different people in areas. Um Those are some of the skills I bring to the table. I am very flexible. I am very a I'm easy going but firm with if I need to be with uh HR related matters. Um And I've had to deal with a number of performance related issues with HR over the years with all the different departments I've had to deal with.

Hi my name is Matthew first of all, thank you for the opportunity to interview for this position. I wanted to start by taking you through my academic qualifications. I, my bachelor degree was in Mathematical Statistics and Operational Research. I studied at Exeter University. After graduating I worked, I've worked in both the private sector and the public sector and my current job is working for an NHS hospital trust in in Surrey. I've worked there about 10 years and during this time I've continued to study, I about four years ago I completed a master's level qualification in Strategic Leadership. And more recently I have just completed my M. B. A. Um I got the qualification about six weeks ago, so I'm very, very pleased about that. It's been three years of hard work whilst working full time and through a global pandemic. Um So that takes me up to where I am now in my qualifications in terms of leadership ability, I work as associate Director of operations, heading up one of the divisions in my hospital, I have about 600 staff in my division. The workers have to remember it working alongside our Chief Nurse and our divisional director. I'm in charge of all the operational management and operational performance in terms of leadership ability. Um I have a natural passion for excellence and a competitive streak that really helps driven to perform well for all the services that fall under my portfolio to ensure that we're delivering the best healthcare but also meeting good, good all the national targets and generally ensuring that our customers have the best service possible. Well, in my leadership, natural leadership traits is is leadership through visibility, which I means I'm I'm not sitting in my office um you know, behind the desk, behind the computer, I'm out on the shop floor mixing with the staff, supporting the staff, making sure that I'm aware of any issues that are happening. Um I've received positive feedback about this because the feedback received is that it shows that I care, which I do. It shows that I have passion for for the services that I manage and passion for the staff and the teams that that work for me um leading by example, you know, it's obviously a cliche but but I feel that it's something that comes naturally to me in terms of um being quite happy to muck in when required, you know, certainly get my hands dirty as needed. Um Other strengths of mine are integrity, that's that's absolutely key. So it's just, it's about doing the right thing. There can be competitiveness between divisions when we're all fighting sometimes for the same resource, the same financials, our capital budgets, but it's about doing the right thing, maintaining my my integrity. Um and that in turn, naturally gives me, I get respect for my my colleagues and the team have worked for me. Um final thing I like to say is it's really the development of my teams there, there are, I think it's absolutely key that in terms of talent management, you have strong members, strong people in your team and it's important two develop them, it's not too sit there and say, well, you know, it's a power, power struggle and I'm the one in charge. So I don't know, learning too much exact opposite actually want them to develop them, I want them to be promoted, I want them to learn new skills and just be happy in the workplace because that's important for their career progression.

I'm the best candidate for the leadership position as a manager. My leadership skills are endless. I can take charge of a team. I am very, very independent. I have numerous experiences working as a way to on my own and shift in the morning. I can take charge of other people and guide them on what to do. If anyone is stop on what they can do, they can come to me and or give them advice and help them develop their skills and just over will improve. Yeah, well, like I said, lots of experience before and managing and even I've done a leadership course in the Lake District which involved taking different group members and reciting the leader of each individual task and seeing who could come out on top who was the best carrying out these leadership roles, what skills they showed as a leader, how comfortable they were being a leader and for these tasks I was nominated as the best leader in our group had the right skills, I could teamwork, market task, be independent. Just overall people to listen to me, get people to support me. And just ever found in between of experiences being a social media analyst and I have been asked to give feedback on social media for business and did a whole presentation on it and I took leadership and making sure that some of these changes were taken into practice and we're all just improving and helping out people who needed guidance on what to do. Also did the same for another company, same social media, looking at different websites. I looked at the range of websites, they're hard on offer and saw what I could give to help improve and change this being trapped in of my football teen when my team has been losing and being able to boost morale and uplift and allow people to make them feel useful and make them feel like they've been heard and just doing what a good leader should do. This would be transferrable into the workplace where I can boost people's motivation and just overall make them you're better at work and make them want to work obviously worth a lot more and if causes me to take on a more independent role, being the dealing with hierarchies and timetables I've done, experiencing that before planning out what people should do, evaluate other people's skills and seen where is best to have them in. Again, back in football, I would obviously help position people, I'd help guide them on what they could do and just anything to help boost their performance, which I can do back in the workplace as well.

I live in South Manchester. I thought you'd like to know why I'm applying for this managerial though? Well, I've had a lot of experience in the past running a variety of projects, both in a professional capacity, but also in a voluntary capacity. These projects have ranged from organizing international conferences, running super fans for the homeless in the city center, running a youth group for people with learning disabilities, supervising people in various volunteer roles um as well as supporting colleagues at my workplace. I feel that all of these activities have given me the skill set that I need to take on a manager. I've been able to experience both leadership from the point of view of someone who's got a leader, who they have to report to, and also I've been in the leadership role myself. Mhm. So from both of those aspects have been able to see how there are lots of different ways that leadership can work from a personal point of view. I like to use role of leadership as leading by example, I think it's very easy for people to think that you should just tell people what to do and you should then expect them to follow your lead. But I think a lot of the time these days we need to show people actually how we want them to work and by setting a good example in all that you do, that's the best way to lead. It shows that you can offer punctuality, it shows that you can offer clarity of decision making and when people see that in youth, they tend to follow it themselves. It also means that people have confidence in you as a leader and I think this is really important as well because if the people who are working for you don't have confidence in you, then they're never going to be able to fulfill their rules and they're never going to come to you if they've got problems or need help or advice. Yeah, So what have I learned from my various leadership rosa han? Well obviously the clear one is delegation at first when I started as a leader in these various roles, I always wanted to do things myself and make sure they were done to the best possible standard and I saw doing them myself as the best way to do this. But obviously you can't go on doing everything yourself and so delegation but also knowing when to delegate, knowing who to delegate to and seeing the clear skill sets that each of the people in your charge have and how they can be suited to the rule in question. That's a really important thing. I think it's also important to see the skills that that people have so that you can really bring them out to themselves and help them reach their potential because if you've got a team of people who feel able to succeed and feel able to reach their potential, then surely this is the best thing for the team that you're managing is the whole, it also means that people are Able to share with one another within the team and support one another. And I think this is really important because you want a team that works well together, you also want a team that feels able to make mistake and doesn't feel as if they're going to be blamed if they do so. Obviously, having said all that, you also need to to be willing to put your foot down and make important decisions. And I've done this in a number of areas. This has resulted in closing projects sometimes when in actual fact that's the best thing to do.

There was, there was an incident with one of my subordinates recently where there was going through a particularly hard time home, the work was suffering and they felt their work was deteriorating on a daily basis. So I took them to one side to discuss what issues was going on. Um They opened up to me, they felt that they could trust me with the information that was given and so from there I've been able to help them along with work and we're on track now for them for their lives to be better and also their workers improved since then and I'm very organized and keep keep up to date with all the management and issues that needs to be addressed on a daily basis. Um arrange meetings with other managers to discuss company matters. I make sure that all the time sheets and everything and all the all the human resource information is passed on diligently and I've implemented some some parts into my department so that we feel more as a team and we started doing and we started interacting outside work as well just to maintain that business slow so that we're close the team and I've got a lot of experience in engineering from from a low level straight through to the management levels so I feel like I can offer the broader view of everything that's that's from from the bottom upwards. Obviously I started at the bottom of the ladder, I'm working my way up so I've got full knowledge of all the departments that had previously worked in which helps me understand exactly how my subordinates and need to work underneath me.

Well, I suppose the main thing is, my personality. I am a born leader. I was always a leader even as I was a child and people were drawn towards me because they I think they knew, I I knew a lot more than other people and have been, I suppose that sounds of this um arrogant. Plus, I think I always think I pick things up quickly more than other people did and I could act in this quicker and I could disseminated the information and work out with to use that information to my advantage and to the team's advantage. So I mean when I was in school I was I was the captain of the football team, I was in the debating teams and and when I was older um No, I mean, I was always fair, just one thing, make sure of, I'd never give out to people, I'd help them if they did something wrong or not correct, I just, no, I wouldn't give out in front of everyone else. I just say, look, I'll take them to the side and explain to them what's right or what's wrong and invariably everybody would be friends and you know, we move on um in my professional life, I've been leaders in various organizations I've worked in. Um I suppose everybody these days work from home, so it's not as obvious that your leader, but when you do convene meetings, I mean I would be the chairman, I would um about the notes. I will explain what the agenda effort next week explain. So I would help the other delegates in their work. If you have any questions, I take them. Okay. It's amazing. I think to be a leader is not just someone who, who, who leads, you have to be seen to be a fair person. You have to be seen to be to do what's right. You have to be seen to know what you're talking about. You have to be seen to be the person that they can come to, um, and they can trust you that you want, that you make it confidential and private and you will try and help him. Um, I suppose I've been in many courses about leadership over the years too. So I picked up various bits and pieces from those, um, those educational tours over time. I mean, you pick out things that suit you. Some things mean everyone's a different kind of leader. Some people are autocratic there to put tom down. You have to tell you others will be will be the exact opposite that they let things flow and the hope that things work out. I'd say I'm somewhere in the middle, um over the years. You know, you pick up, as I said, you pick up different tidbits of knowledge and you make them, so do me, nobody knows everything is my daughter says to me all the time, but you, you know what, you know, and you try and use it in the various situations that come up every day. Sometimes you get around of course, but you pick stuff up again and you you try and understand where I went wrong and in the future do what choice. But as I said, no single day is the exact same day before. So every day something new comes up. So you there's no way you can, you can you can you can know what's going to happen next day. So you have to work on your instinct, sometimes sometimes working experience. Sometimes you you work on textbook knowledge because it's the exact same thing that came up before another situation, another organization and it was worked out. So the trick is I think to be leaders, you have the confident yourself, you have to try and help others and you have to be there for them and always give your best shot. Don't hide, get yourself out there job, give it a go. And that's the only way you can learn things. As I said, you're bound to fall and fail sometimes what that's life, no matter what you do, if you work in a leader an organization, it will work as 18 an organization. You come across different situations and you just have to your best. So I think I'm the leader here.

So I have the skill to drive things forward and take charge in situations. I have a quite a wider range of experience, working in that from healthcare and in the pharmaceutical industry, working my way up in supervisory positions, having lower levels of responsibility already and working myself up to management in both areas in public health care as well as private pharmaceuticals. What makes a good leader? It's a variety of different things. You need to have the ability to be able to people manage really well. You have to have the ability to be able to look at the objectives, the long term, short term, medium term and choreograph not only your objectives with an escape, you've got uh as well as your stuff, you have to be able to have diplomacy when things are going wrong, you have to be able to choreograph people's skills set, make sure that the right people in the right places at the right time to be the most efficient. You have a strong desire to be ambitious. Um, you need to be able to have a strong level of dynamism. It means to be calm. Need to be collected. Um, I could keep going on. Um nonetheless, um, I have a lot of experience when it comes to being a manager in particular such disease in healthcare and in pharmaceuticals. Um, I've got examples where I've defused issues where colleagues, where they've questioned professional ethics of each other in terms of Iranians test results, where people have accused each other of sabotage have been added to fuse those situations by addressing informally with colleagues and formally to ensure that things can go smoothly resolve the issues they have with each other. I have a lot of experience of choreographing from just scheduling but setting up workflows, making sure I'm there investigating when things go wrong. Um Making sure staff are appropriately trained, these things will count into leadership. You have to have everything on board to be a good leader. Um Yeah you have to, you have to make sure the all your projects are done accordingly and that's a mixture of knowing what you need to do for yourself up, material management, that's also what you need for helping us stock and get the best out of them as well. Um As well as keeping the morale up as well. Um but you know income seeing more of a leader, you have to have that drive that enables you to want to stay forward at every single moment. You have to kind of be continuously hungry and in some sense it is never satisfied in some ways but not in the sense of being ah apathetic or not willing to continue to cause but to just continually wanting to strive for more no matter how much you improve your always saying yourself from that next girl and that's not just for yourself, but you're doing that for everyone. Um it's it's all about being part of a wider team within a team leader acknowledges their weaknesses as well. So while I've talked about strengths as well, you have to sort of focus a lot on what makes individuals weekend leaders like anyone, whether they're subordinate or not, um or have their own flaws and fallacies. Um and if you're able to be self aware and work on them or especially learn off others while being a leader that will make you strong as well, um I'll tell me this it's cliche, but you have to kind of be that all rounder in a way.

My name is Graham and I just want to make this short video to display to you why I have leadership characteristics and I would be the best person for the position that you are offering. Let me start by giving a little bit of background into my work history. I've been in the same company that aerospace industry i. e. The military for around 22 years. I started at the bottom and made my way up through pretty much all of the ranks and I'm sitting pretty much one rank off the top now to be quite honest. Uh my current role I have leadership every single day. I am the manager of a shift of 65 people who come to me for guidance mentoring. A mainly major leadership day to day basis on how we're going to move forward and progress task to in effect accomplish the mission that we required for the day which is in my business we need to present. So I provide serviceable aircraft for war pilots to fly so they can conduct the training too. Uh huh provide defense for the new nation. A leadership from various from day to day in the U. K. It will just be general guidance but I'll give you in my past a little example of when I show leadership which would be say back on operations. I was a shift lead not quite as high as Jeff lead as I am now but slightly more junior in ranks. We had an aircraft crash in quite a hostile situation I would say and I got the phone call. I'm sorry. I didn't get a phone call. Someone else got the phone call and basically everybody lived to me a bit of stunned because it's quite uncommon. So why don't don't I cleared the room. I chatted with my senior management team and we got together a very quick plan, an action plan to show the way forward. And then we got the team together to quell any rumors. I briefed the whole team. I told him not to worry what we're going to do and everybody would be fine and I just reassured everybody. Uh, this is the business we're in. It's part of the job and we just have to move forward. Yeah. So that is just a little bit leadership. Their leadership and the military can be uh, common when you're not expecting a being the leader on the ground during ground attacks, indirect fire attacks, ah leadership and then cases and more for the more junior guys. This is quite strange to them and they just, they just really need reassurance at this stage. So throughout my career I had a, for a career progression, I had to move to work embedded in industry where they make aircraft just to be a lead a military lead. That could be the leos leos on directly between myself, the military and the, the aircraft manufacturers. This, uh, this was probably fatal to move my career forward. So in short, just summarize a, I've been in a position of leadership for nine years as I've worked my way up through the ranks, I have provided leadership both in the UK uh overseas on combat operations. Mhm I am extremely adoptable. I can work anywhere, any environment, not just climatic environments. As I said, I've worked with an industry and that was totally different to military but I adapted myself and ah I performed, I got pulled out of that job so it was obvious that I could perform and The main reason you should deployment employ me. One of the main reasons is I am highly dedicated. I have been in the military 23 mostly 22 coming on 23 years and I am dedicated from the morning the minute I walk into work in the morning till the I go home at night time summary.

Um So the first thing I can think of is in my university, I was President of two different social groups. Um And so with the first group this role um It involved organizing meetings with all of the other executive members. Um And within those meetings there would be a set agenda would be planning out our events for the year basically. Um And we would just be doing general event organization together. The role involved a lot of me delegating tasks. Um I would be in contact with our secretary before those meetings just to plan out the agenda and figure out what needs to be talked about during the meetings. Um And then when it came to the actual meetings that would be the delegation of tasks. They would be talking about each individual event, figuring out any um anything we needed to order or create or plan for those events. So for example um sorting out printing for marketing material, um setting a budget, um figuring out any food and drinks that we would need to buy to provide to our members. Um And this would also go to external events events outside the unit. For example, if we're going to conventions or anything, some of these events, we sold things like we'd create merchandise, like art, posters, drawings and we'd have to sell those. So there would be organization of getting people to draw that stuff and then sorting out the printing, um and then having all that stuff packed and ready to be taken to the convention and then sold. So that was with one of the groups with the other group. There was the additional um, bit of organizing stuff with teachers because there was a japanese cultural group. And so we'd organized stuff with the japanese teachers. For example, if they had any events that they wanted to advertise with the wider japanese community that we could advertise to our members. They'd let us know about that if they wanted us to advertise our group during the classes so that students could join and learn more about japan. Um we would organize those two, we also organize little um kind of study groups and help groups for students so that they could try and practice the japanese for assessments and things like that. Um Yeah, so um that's basically what was mainly um, my main leadership um, leadership requirements from those two. Um The other thing I can think of is when I, the first job I got into was as a grocery in a grocery store. Um I just started off as a cashier and then after a few years, um we hired a few more members and so I was involved in the hiring of those people and also um eventually the training of them as well once they joined and so that involved getting them familiar with how the actual cash register works, getting them familiar with stock, how to stock shelves, where to grab the stock from and where to place it. Um What kind of each of our items was in general use for those who, when customers asked, they'd be able to give them help. Um There would also be um some of our customers had like a I guess like a cash balance owing. So they'd take in um some items and then paid off once a week. And so I kind of let our staff members know where this was stored, how to add to it, how much to limit them at, went to where the market off when they take payments for that, things like that. Um I would also order stock um for the store and um would let people know when that stock was coming, where to place it, when it comes approximately when it would be delivered, Things like that. Um So just general kind of um management sort of I guess basically a manager role in that story, even though it was in sort of assigned that way, I was given that role just basically because of how long I had been working at the store and just because I was more of a senior employee at the store. Um So yeah, there's a main things I can think of where I do have leash experience and how I can see how some of the tasks I conducted in those roles would help me in a management position.",NEUTRAL,0.1967,0.0352,0.6778,0.0903,778.0,HIGH,15,99.0,2.0,Using only (2),11.87,0,1,0,"Bachelor's degree (e.g. BA, BS)",Male,8.269906,8.008251,8.532959

I believe I would be an ideal fit for your vacancy for management. The reasons for that are that I believe I'm a very effective leader. I have considerable proven experience in my current employer in that regard, having completed an 18-month training course on leadership and I believe in working in the context of the model that is um completing tasks efficiently, get by getting the best out of myself and my team to do that. I've taken numerous courses on developing individuals, developing my team and my staff obviously achieving the actual task is vital, so we and I go into that with a focus on achieving the goal. However, building and maintaining the team, obviously the third part of the model is also very, very crucial. Um I coach and mentor my staff to make sure that they're engaged, excited and involved in projects that I run. Um I've also been influential in many projects my team and I typically we deliver those on time and under budget. The environment in which I work is often busy, there are multiple tasks at the same time that that need to be achieved many plates spinning. So I think being effective leader is all about managing the decisions, learning to prioritize and learning to delegate as I've said, uh it's no easy feat sometimes when you've got all of these tasks going around, but I think I've been effective that I have, I believe an understanding of what's important and what's not important. So learning to almost pick apart a task, take perhaps pieces of it, distribute that out to different members of the team. I also encourage my team to seek feedback as well when they've completed a task with re firm believers in uh examining and reflecting on what we did right and what we did wrong. So we can learn lessons from from pieces of work and projects. I believe that those ideas that have come directly from me make me a very effective leader and manager. And as I say, I believe that these qualities lend myself very well to candidacy for your management position, turning down to the actual results. We deliver the the client, excuse me. The client only ends up seeing the project, the deliverable. Uh And ultimately, you might say that that's what it's about. But as I said at the beginning of the interview, uh because I try and work within the confines of your data model, I also believe that whilst we're doing that in the background, the thing that the client doesn't see is the development of the team itself. So I want to encourage those more junior too, take a more senior role, take a more uh push push themselves to push their boundaries, I guess you might say, um and to be and feel supported while they're doing that. And that's what I try and provide his guidance and support as well whilst I've delegated effectively. So in summary, I believe those are the those are the qualities of a great leader, certainly their qualities that that I believe I exhibit. And yes, I do think that I'd be an ideal candidate for this role on the basis of what I've just described, if you like, we can talk about some specific projects that I've done, where we've managed to deliver as a team on time and under budget. And I think that that in itself speaks volumes for my leadership skills as well.

I've been a leader in the workplace for about 25 years, I'd say I've had people reporting to me. And this is mostly in the context of leading education for a multinational international grant making Foundation. So my role is to the teams of trainers and teams of developers who are developing course software. And I think that what's important from the standpoint of leading is that, first of all, you have to put the right people in the right role. By which, I mean, you have to know people and know the job well enough to make sure the people that you work with and higher are the people who can perform the task. And a large part of task performance is responding to situations that are new and undocumented. So I put my staff through training in dealing with problems that we haven't seen as a team before. And so I think an important part of being a leader is to empower the people who work for you to make decisions on their own when they confront novel challenges in an organization. And I think in doing so, you not only empower your staff, but you make them feel needed, you make them feel committed to the team and you encourage them to think outside of the box and to take a step beyond what they think is required in the job. I asked everyone to perform as if they had the job they want, rather than the job they have. I think that's an important skill in leadership and it leads to a more committed staff. Now another part of leadership sort of the other side of the coin is dealing with problem team members, not everyone and the team is committed to the task not everyone. And the team is even capable of doing the task and try as you may to hire the right people. Things change. People make mistakes or technology changes so that people don't change with it and it's necessary sometimes to make changes. So when I think a team member is having problems I try to first of all be as proactive as possible which means talk to them, find out if there's anything going on in their lives or they are out of work time that's in pinching upon their ability to do a good job. Sometimes there is and we can deal with that. Then other times we need to dig a little deeper. I asked them what's going on usually that's all I have to do is invite them to my office, sit down, offer them a cup of tea and and just say joe what's going on with you. I just had a feeling we needed to talk And nine times out of 10 the floodgates at that point will open and people are telling me about their biggest challenge in the workplace and so once we know what the challenges then we can solve it.

Um Finally I went well holding that business, I went to university during the mid nineties, early mid nineties recession and studied accounting and economics came out there and went to the city where I worked in in the back office and I used to run reconciliations teams which were sometimes they would be stopped reconciliations and sometimes they would be there would be cash. Um I became part qualified management accountant during that time also gets some futures trading. Um But from the point of view of um oh far alternative medicine and the use of But he didn't say I became very interested in after I had a heart scan and uh in Harley Street. And they set me off saying, don't read this book saying heart disease by Patrick Holford. Which which I did And it was extremely interesting. And I learned about how, how there is really what you would call medical fraud going on. Because for some considerable time now, several 100 years, probably 450. It's been well, doctor health useful vitamin C is in helping people recover from very serious illnesses, including things like bleeding from the from the bladder, which I've, which I've got a test on myself um and scurvy.

I've been asked to record a video to highlight my management abilities and experience. Also, with a brief introduction, my name is Mike and I'm 55 now, living in Colmar originally from the Northwest. Um throughout my 30th year career working to realize, spent 80% of it management roles I would guess. Originally started off as a A young 19 year old is a training manager with Wh Smith. within 18 months They've without for two years, got a bit disillusioned, went to university, got a degree for three years and fell back into retail management for the rest of the 20s, worked for wh smith, um forwards, curries and Iceland. Um Then I was asked to run a pub which I did for three years, which was a great experience and very testing of all your management ability and people skills amongst other things. I've also managed a betting shop, Ladbrokes for two years. I've been a team leader in a call center E for six years. I've had my own shop for three years. Stick very well, let's hold that, 14 on the railways as a gang leader of the team 14 and then I set up my own business as a handyman decorator, employed five guys and killed that off unfortunately. But across the board there's been a lot of success with figures, targets, whatever generally met comfortably. Um And I've always found that what enables that is a happy team, the happier the work is, the more productive I find that they are, so my style has always been as relaxed as possible. Obviously there are times and places where that's not feasible, but generally very relaxed, very relaxed. I'd like people to get on. I want to get on with people. I like to help encourage train promote wherever possible. Just give people carrots rather than sticks because I firmly believe that you get a lot more out of them. Um as I say, my my results of across the board have proved that to be successful for me. Um and it's hard to hard to be changing my management style. Now, my abilities are probably my biggest strength is my communication skills. Despite this video, I am a good communicator and I can communicate with people right across the board from the Lord and Lady of the Manor, which is part of my current role now down to young apprentices, which again, I also have to deal with daily basis. I currently work for my local town council in charge of the operations team, which means we basically do anything and everything that needs to be done around the town. Mm hmm. And it's something I enjoy and I find that my enjoyment means I do a better job, which means I get more out of my team, which means I enjoy it. And as I said that I firmly believe a happy ship is a productive ship. Um that's always been my management style from the outside. Some people might say I'm too relaxed, brazil's across the way have proved that that stuff certainly works for me and I remain in touch with people I've worked with for many years, many years ago, I'm still in contact with them because as far as possible, I always like to become friends as well as colleagues. That's again, that's not always the case, but it's not always practical, but that's the way I approach my management roles, but not the best video.

Communication amongst employees is key to success. You must have enthusiasm and a drive and a will two create the best working environment for all parties concerned in this day and age. It's too easy to get disillusioned, downhearted and a general feeling of Moreau's as things do not go the way one anticipates on a daily basis. It's the job of a supervisor to ensure that his staff while efficient are basically happy at their work to know as much as you can about an employee and the ability to spot if your employee seems to be of color for any reason at this stage, it's the job of the supervisor to ensure that he can do everything to ensure that his workforce are giving of their best at all times by ensuring that they have the best working practices and environment around them. What does the company expect from employees in this day and age? Depending on the company, loyalty would be a key factor and an ability to work under any circumstances. And our job, there is an element of working outside and therefore the health and safety aspects are key to ensure that your employees have the best safety equipment available and a safe working environment. Again, my experience is key in this area. As a previously stated, I have 13 years of experience in a supervisory role and these environments, there is no substitute for experience and staff under you must have confidence and the leadership and the more experience you are, the more security you give your employees. The employees must also feel that they are able to turn here and be able to outline any problems that you have, knowing that you will take all on board and use absolute discretion in every aspect of this area of responsibility.

I have spent a significant amount of time with the company with a great knowledge of internal affairs all the way from R. And D. Q. A. And technical writing through to HR admin and general workflows. I have constantly interacted positively with people who have wide range of expertise in seniority and I'm confident in my ability to modulate my tone of speaking and the information which I deliver so as to get everyone on board with the facts that are required, facilitating an efficient and comforting work environment. I believe my volunteering opportunities have given me a strong empathetic foundation with which to relate to colleagues and be able to offer collegial support such as to maintain a positive work environment which ultimately provides fruitful outputs for the company.

I was also responsible for designing and arranging promotional media for events to be displayed on the students Union digital science around campus. I've written guidelines and all the society's social and digital media uh huh. So I can pass on this responsibility to the next secretary when my term comes to an end. As I mentioned in my application following an incident that I helped out with while working at ASDA. My manager asked me to help to plan and be involved in the induction and training of new staff uh and to offer my perspective on the issues and procedures addressed. It's part of my contribution. I identified some inconsistencies in staff training in different departments that were having an impact on how customer feedback and complaints were being dealt with. Slightly different messages were being conveyed by different members of staff and that led some confusion. Uh On one occasion a complaint from a customer became quite serious and escalated. So I discussed this with my manager uh pointing out inconsistencies and suggested what I felt was a more effective procedure which resulted in a more consistent approach across all departments. As a result, a more efficient process is now followed with positive feedback from staff that clearer on how to deal with any issues that arise in addition to a tangible decrease in complaints received across the board, particularly during covid. I've demonstrated my ability to work flexibly and maintain strong communication links whilst working from home. A considerable amount of our workflow has adjusted online which is meant creating guideline documents, uh efficient sorting procedures in terms of online storage folders and facilitating meetings through the organization of regular weekly meetings. I ensure these meetings allow the contribution of a wide variety of ideas around the topic being discussed and I give colleagues and open door policy with regard to issues of complaints. They may have no matter the topic. I have a strong policy of transparency which I believe helps to create more vibrant work environment which is conducive to greater outputs.

My front runner role is social media related in communications and external relations. And part of the role is social is launching and overseeing social media campaigns and a recent campaign aimed at prospective students Bruce so popular that overseeing the resulting communications was taken up most of the time.

Um The idea of an additional management role on taking it on is something that I have been working towards for quite a while since joining this company. Um As many of you may already know in previous roles at other companies. Um I generally almost always held management positions. Um I have, you know, a total of five years as a manager. Um and I think one thing that is unique about those five managerial years is that they occurred at a variety of companies. And what I mean by that is, you know, at one position at one job, there were, you know, 200 employees called a mid sized company. We had foreign owners and so there was an interesting management element there that need to be considered. Additionally, I was a manager at a 50 person startup company um And I reported to the founder and managed a team of three And then in my other role, um I was at a 60,000 person technology company and also managing a team of 15. Um so I know how to manage based on the environment and and understand the scale of where we're at and I think that that is something that really allows me to look at things holistically and zoomed out and also really garnered a unique skill set from each of those um experiences that I think make me a much better manager than someone who has been at the same company are working within the same constraints for quite a while. Um You know, first and foremost, when I am joining a team, um whether I'm going to be in a managerial role or not, I think it is crucial um to be a good leader, um whether your title makes you later or not, that you establish great working relationships with your team and cross functionally. Um without that any time you need to do something with your team or with another team, um Things feel like they are favors and there are silos and that doesn't make for a positive work experience for many. And it also, you know, I don't really think really adds to your ability to contribute to the company and the bottom line. And so I think, you know, first and foremost relationships were humans, um I need to know some things about you, what are your interests, um Do you have, you know, certain pet peeves or working styles that are better for you? Um And you know, I think once you have that it just makes things so much easier um to succeed and to feel fulfilled. Um So I think that is something that I really, you know, get to know the people and then a big thing that I like to do with teammates and subordinates is to create a safe space um where all I'm I think feedback is crucial, we should all be open minded, let's, you know, throw ideas up on the board, tell me, you know, if I'm not being a good enough manager or colleague and how I could better support you. Another thing it kind of related to feedback is, I think it's so important that employees um know what the common goal is of the company and so that they can feel that they are working hard for a win, that is a win for all. People need that motivation and I am someone who, once I know a common company goal, I want to communicate that I'm all about transparency. Another thing that I think is so important is people go on tangents or you know, or get stuck in a negative space. I'm someone who likes to break up the noise, tell people things straight and say, hey guys, this isn't working, let's recalibrate, even if that means, you know that it's going to be more work for me or us, but I think it's important just to be able to be flexible and adapt as a leader and inspire that and create that vibe among your team. And I think, you know, I am someone who I care about people's career development and as a leader to tell someone that that hey, what do you want to do in five years? People feel taken care of and want to give you better work and again, that relates to kind of the human element that I prioritize.

The first I think is just general leadership and management experience. So I'm I'm 33 years old and I've had a lot of different types of leadership experience and not just corporate and business type experience. I was starting when I was really, really young, I was captain of my soccer team and like, And I was like 12 and then I was captain of the high school soccer team when I was like 16, and I was captain of the track team when I was 18, and then in college I was captain of that track team and then I went into the business world and I was promoted a few times and eventually where I am today, which is a Director of Finance. So um a lot of different leadership experience and most of them were by vote or um I didn't apply for any of them, this is I guess an exception here. Um so I think generally if if left to my peers, I I don't, I always begrudgingly take the management position. I don't particularly like to be in that position. I don't view it as being in charge, but over that time I did gain a lot of experience, I realized the most first and foremost that you get there by people liking to be around you. And that was kind of the lesson I learned throughout my childhood that allowed me to be successful in a more formal kind of corporate environment. Um going all the way back to when I was on those soccer teams, it was like, it wasn't about trying to do drills the fastest or be the coach's pet, it was just about having fun on the field, trying to execute the goal and help the team win. And I kind of just took those really simple approaches throughout my life because they worked, so and they've continued to work. So I think um more formal experience that's more directly related to this role would be my management of in my finance roles that I've had, which have ranged from manager, senior manager to a couple levels of directors with teams that varied in size and experience. I've managed people that just came out of college as their very first job which is a lot different than managing people that are 30 years senior to me that have a lot more career in life experience um compared with myself, so that was that range of different people um was really humbling in a lot of ways. I found myself in a lot of positions where I manage people that knew way more than me about even management, I won't even say the subject matter, they actually, if we flipped places, they would have done a better job. So um just kind of approaching it with humility. I've absorbed a lot. So I think all of that, I kind of roll up into saying management experience. Um So I think another reason that I would be a good fit for this manager role is all that experience has taught me that I am not, I'm not the main ingredient for the success of the team, I'm just kind of, I try to do what I can, but I also realize that the more I do, the the worst the team is probably going to perform, I found that managing is kind of just like asserting is subtle guidance here and there and generally just trying to keep the spirits high and let the team have autonomy and make sure everyone understands their role and kind of just create a, make sure that the vision is there and as long as the vision is intact and everyone kind of knows where they are as a part of that, doing my best to just kind of make sure things are running smoothly and that everyone's having fun and I'm not in the kind of corporate sense of the word fun, but maybe just, they're happy to be there and they don't know that they are at work and maybe sometimes they forget that they're there for a paycheck, that would kind of be my goal. So I think I've seen a lot of different managers through my life and I've taken the good and tried to learn from them and then I have seen things that as I've been managed, I've always had a manager, so I've tried not to emulate the things that, that, that I haven't enjoyed um from my manager. So um I look forward to continuing to get even more experienced managing in this new role. So I hope you'll consider me thanks.",NEUTRAL,0.3272,0.0405,0.6293,0.003,802.0,HIGH,12,99.0,2.0,Using only (2),14.78,0,1,0,"Bachelor's degree (e.g. BA, BS)",Male,9.120789,8.856225,8.662167

Um Never really meant to, but when I was about 10, 11 years old, I would always be the one that did match reports at school when we played team sports mainly football um Used to play, the match is obviously against other schools, and then the captain would Ryan Metropol and read it out to the rest of the school the next day at school assembly. Um And that was when I was about 10, so without meaning to, I think I saw naturally built up leadership skills from when I was very young and that then followed me into secondary school as a teenager. Um And I think he just sort of ingrained in me the ability to kind of communicating quite an effective way because when you're that young you just sort of being natural, so you're just, you know, I wasn't taught, I wasn't told this is what you have to say, this is what you have to do, it was just sort of completely natural to me. And I think when I then left school um Mhm, sort of late teens, early twenties and then worked in a supermarket and for whatever reason, as a team of us. Um even though I was just the same as everyone else irregular shelf stacker, it would often be me that was sort of helping other people or they'd ask me about something. Um Yeah, so it's almost like I naturally have those sort of leadership skills, I'm not too sure why, but I think it's partly because I'm quite neutral personality um I'm not massively introverted and not massively extroverted, so I think I naturally get on with people across the spectrum whether they're super quiet or super loud, um I don't have an extreme personality one way or another, so pretty much everyone seems to get on with me, people seem to find me quite likable, which I think is quite important um if you're in a leadership position that um no matter what sort of coaches, someone's came from all backgrounds from there, immediately sort of okay with you because you're not extreme in one way or another and I think communication is important and just because of the way I am quite a sort of calm communicator I suppose no matter what the situation um Again I don't know why that is, I think it's just completely natural, I don't think I've ever practiced er or um you know self consciously for about it, it's just uh I think it is just naturally my personality rather than me trying to be like that and I think when you're in a sort of leadership position, you want to and you know inspire people, you want to inspire them in a natural way there, I think I don't think you want to force the issue massively, I think you can sort of inspire people um in the short term by giving them a little pep talk and stuff, but I think you inspire people better over the long term by just naturally being a good manager and a good communicator and having those leadership abilities, I think somebody will be good Working for you all with you for 10 years if you're naturally friendly, naturally a good communicator, naturally a calm person. Um I think you inspire them without them realizing it. So I think that's more the category that I fall into rather than being good at giving someone a the boot took the bomb to make them work hard for one week. I think my two of leadership, natural leadership abilities allow me to you know sort of inspire people to work gradually for years and because I am quite a I'd sort of say um sympathetic person, I would say I can, you know, I can read somebody if they're um not their normal selves or whatever. I think that leads itself quite well to good leadership abilities as well because um yeah you can sort of adapt to that person and if you need to take a bit of pressure off them you can delegate of a um you know tasks to other people to take the pressure off that person. Um So yeah, I think without meaning to, I naturally have a lot of leadership skills and abilities and I am quite um I guess self reflective would be the word, quite humble as well. I don't think I rate my shot myself as some big shot and I think that helps the leadership as well because if you believe your own hype, I think here, you know, it has a negative effect.

So I attained my Bachelor's degree from Imperial College London in Finance. Within the UK. Imperial College London is one of the best universities, um It's well within the top three universities in the UK, um and that shows the level of ambition how personally for me, I and we're seeking to push the boundaries. I would say that within the last 21 years that I've been in the finance industry, um the last 15 years or so, I have been in senior management positions, there's a lot of qualities through trial and error that I picked up over the years, which I think have turned me into a very efficient and effective manager. Firstly, I do not believe in any of the management team having a sense of fear, I think is counterproductive. I don't think it's a healthy environment for your team, and I also believe that it would ensure probably the most least effective uh in regards to productivity. I believe in a more collaborative approach where I sit down with the management, middle management team and explain to them why a particular project is important, how whatever we are doing as a team, because hand in hand with the rest of the department and how that's going to benefit the organization. I've been in situations. My previous position was as a senior stockbroker. Um several of the individuals who was managing Were 15, 20 years uh older than me, however, I often found that they had a sense of respect for me and I believe that one of the reasons for it is number one, I am not the type of person who screams and shouts, I tend to be quite quiet, so when there is something to be said, that's the only time you will see me talking. I also believe that I have emotional maturity. I do not tend to get emotional within the workplace as I personally believe that that can be counterproductive. I'm a fair individual, always give credit where credit is due and I personally believe that is extremely important to highlight when a middle manager is doing very well. I also believe that the approach that I take tends to ensure that the middle managers are working with me, they are pushing harder, We create an environment which is a collaborative environment. I one would want them to know that if they require any sort of help, any sort of hands on approach or input from me, they will get that regardless of what time it is. I do not believe in micromanaging anybody. I think it's counterproductive for any manager to migrant manage because fundamentally it just means that it's time consuming and it takes them away from ensuring the task that they were employed to do. Um But having said that, I think it's very important as a manager to know when you do need to intervene, when you do need to make a judgment call. Um and these are Qualities that I've picked up over the last 15 to 15 years or so, and that's why I personally believe that I would be ideally suited for this role.

So I have um previous extensive leadership and management experience from time in the military and time spent as a helicopter pilot in the military. Um One of the things that I one of the most important things that I ever learned as far as leadership management goes um was in one of my first lectures on joining the military about leadership. Um We were fed all of the definitions of what makes a good leader who's been a good leader, what makes you a good manager and so on and so forth. But one of the things that actually stuck with me was that leadership is as a leader, it is getting people to do something that they don't want to do or may not otherwise want to do. And I always found that really interesting and in its simplest terms, um it is actually something that I've used quite a lot of in my time in the military. Um and one of the biggest things that I've found, one of the biggest qualities that you can have as a leader is empathy and yeah, empathy with not just kind of what the people that you're trying to lead um going through or what they may be asked to do, but just empathy with people and understanding that you may ask people to do things that they might not want to do. Um And there's a way to go about asking people or instructing people um how to do something. So that is really important and I think that's something that I've used quite a lot of um in my time as a as a leader and a manager, as an officer in the military and as a helicopter pilot, I've been asked to make a lot of difficult decisions and a lot of made a lot of challenging calls and ask people to do lots of things that they don't otherwise want to do. Um So I think one of the biggest things that I could bring is as a leader of management is first of all quite a lot of experience, but also um just being kind of being a kind of nice approachable guy, being someone that has experienced those things that I may be trying to ask people to do or get people to do. Um working with the strength of your team and working with experienced that members of the team of God is also really important because there are things of course that as a leader or manager you won't have done and I certainly haven't done everything in different fields. And so being aware that again in the military, one of the things I found is that there were people that had been there a lot longer than me when I was a lot younger people have been there a lot longer than me and looking at me as a kind of youngster trying to instruct them what to do. Um and they were looking at me questioning kind of random and this guy hasn't done anything. Um so embrace that and use that and put those people in a position where they feel wanted and valued and use that experience and constantly kind of soak up information and knowledge and the experience of others around you. There's never any place for shouting as far as I'm concerned. Um There are situations where it is an absolute necessity and particularly in the military, but in civilian life and in organizations, there's never any place for anger, shouting. Um and that kind of talking down to people that you see quite a lot of, I can't stand management speak or leadership speak, so put things in plain english, talk to people honestly. Um and just again, it all comes down to being a nice person, talk to somebody the way in which you'd like to be spoken to yourself um and be friendly, but um make it clear that you are in charge, but you can do that in a nice way without being an idiot and without being somebody that ultimately the people won't like or follow.

Secondly, it's about reviewing their practice in the classroom, making sure that they feel confident in there practice and they're teaching their skill to be able to deliver good science lessons, match the curriculum and allow learners to achieve their best. Thirdly, I think this is the most important one. It's about reviewing, reviewing and improving because without having a chance to look back at your lessons, how will we ever improve? So that's on the coal face. I think that that is one of the most important things that being a good leader, being a facilitator already Important. 2nd part of that is being a barrier between issues outside of the classroom and in the classroom. So I see my part of my role as being there to deal with parents tricky students that will allow the learning to continue in a way that is, is optimal for learning. So in my role as a science leader at my current school, I was actually part of a big project which meant that I actually had the opportunity to redesign the curriculum from scratch because as we know the problem part of the child is being able to start from scratch with new curriculum when they come around and making sure that not only are you meeting it, but the provision meets your school because each school's Children are different fundamentally. That is one of the most important things in different schools that makes them unique. We all teach very similar things at the end of the day, we need to understand our cohort, make sure that they are being taught the curriculum. For example, in the current school is not a very affluent area and the majority of our Children are actually, and so that means english is additional language and we have many learners who are from different cultural backgrounds. So therefore we decided we wanted our curriculum to best match that. So we sat down and we felt key scientists that all of our learners would have an idea of who they are, We thought this would be best because then the Children would feel that they're being represented in their own learning. So we haven't had a real problem in our school with most of our, you know, curriculum being very white and very male. So it was something that we addressed. Another thing in my current role that I did is a science league was I made sure that I mapped out the progression. This is an important part of the Office of framework now, is making sure that we can rightly address progression within our school. So what progression is, is how does science move on from Early years, all the way to year six in between? Because for example, if we take plants, if every year Children learn about plants and these plants, you know, they do the exact same things that they do every single year, the learning is not moving on at all. So we need to make sure that, you know, In year one, they're learning about the different vocabulary, so roots, Petals, and then by year six they're learning a lot more detail in the workings of a plant and how it reproduces, for example.

Yeah such as such. I believe these are the main qualities required for a management. No, and that's why I feel have a good candidate overall. I feel I would have a good chance of this managerial position and I would shoot, we'll put it and in general a few closure of I take a positive attitude into the work push I believe and being positive, having a positive outlook and being positive makes a big difference when it comes to management. Having positivity, determination and creativity alongside good people. Management skills are some of the factors that make a good manager and that's why I feel would be a good manager and that's all I'm quite sure about that. I want to add a couple of extra things on to us. I also believe believe making a good impression on the team that are managing and also believe and keeping a happy team, happy team means a productive team and the productive team is good for the company. And as such, I feel that's very important and fuel uh huh It will uh will benefit everyone to have a positive attitude to management, benefits both the management and both the and tribal employees.

I do have a PhD um and uh conducting high and highly sophisticated work uh and implementing uh complex workflows in understanding the biology and especially implementing novel technology to probe and advance therapeutic discovery for various biological issues. Um And so just to give you a broad overview of our research is focused on on really getting at key questions involving ideology um and which means really sort of understanding the underlying biological processes that immediately sort of precipitate or lead to uh certain symptom Atala jeez. Um And so there is a strong interface between the basic biology and how that co ops or interfaces with the clinical finna types that various patients show. And so over the course of the last several years, what we've discovered is that there are certain key processes Uh that become abrogated over time. Um and this could be due to genetic perturbations or environmental issues that exacerbates one risk uh to develop certain conditions. And so the more we understand about these basic and fundamental processes, the quicker we can implement novel technologies on that front, I think a lot, given the tremendous expands in the technological space and the implementation of novel methodologies uh we're really using a multi modal approach in getting at these core fundamental processes. So for example, something that we are really interested is in pursuing nanotechnologies and how that can potentially alleviate various symptom Atala jeez uh as part of my responsibilities as a leader, as a supervisor, as the manager of trained various uh investigators at multiple different career stages um and many of them have gone on um to implement various workforce in their respective areas of specialization. Um and part of that is predicated on really uh transforming our theoretical knowledge and taking that into practice um and you know, that entailed certain complications in certain complexities that have to be navigated. Um and uh part of what I have been able to, I hope successfully do is collaborate with multiple different investigators across multiple different areas of specialization and niche is to uh to come together in a convergent manner in probing uh a certain overarching question or specifically directing our hypotheses into a meaningful and translational way. And this has been incredibly fruitful, it's been incredibly exciting, exhilarating to deal with the various adversities um that come with this type of high risk, high reward type of work.

I do think it is important to say that I bring a lot of experience in managing people um as well as varied experience in managing people. So when I look back across my background, I have experience managing in multiple industries. So I have been over sales and customer service teams providing different aspects there, but I've done it in manufacturing, I have done it in service industries such as educational services, and I have even done it in um service industries such as corporate travel, so having that experience and then um within each of those industries, uh specifically when we look at something like manufacturing, you know, I worked for years at a manufacturer leading um a large customer service team there and then I also worked for a distributor of manufacturing goods, giving a different perspective on how things work. So I think that that experience both broadly speaking in how much experience I have and kind of seeing different situations and understanding different situations Um certainly comes into play. But then when you look at the nuances of it, the size of the team, you know, looking at one of my past backgrounds, I've had experience doing 127 indirect reports with 10 direct reports and and managing um that customer service group. And I've had as low as six people working all directly for me. Um and and that gives you a great balance on how do you do things like delegation right as a manager, you can't do everything yourself, it's, you know, everybody talks about how it's it's hard making that transition from, you know, if I want it done right, I'm gonna have to do it myself and make sure that's done. So you learn how to delegate when you have those larger groups, but you also learn how to care personally when you work with some of the smaller groups. It it teaches you the perspective that when you're working David Day one on one with everybody um and you really have to figure out exactly what it is that that makes you a strong leader um those those interactive, those those one on one relationships help when you look at like what really makes a leader. I think a lot of it is equivalent to teaching um the strength of what I do and have always done has been in teaching other people. So uh you know, I have had people in the past to have said uh you know, it's it's tough working for you because you you never just answer my question, you always ask me where I've looked or how I found the answer. Um and in the end you kind of still want people looking at it that way you the job of manager of of course is to handle escalations and and be able to maintain a clear line of head as well as think strategically those are all portions of it, but some of it is about improving your people and improving your people is often overlooked as hey, so, uh, if I have a customer service rather than, you know, your job is to make them a manager or, um, to move into another department and that's not always the case. Sometimes it's just making them the best customer service rep that they can be if that's what they're happy doing. So the best way to do that is to teach and when you're teaching, you have to be willing to learn and listen and sit down. So if, if somebody says, hey, I don't know how to do this and I say, I don't know how to do it either. We're gonna go learn it together. We're gonna go figure that answer out. Um, and then, you know, if you need a reminder next time, hopefully I'm still remembering it and we've walked through that process, but it makes you a part of their investment. So they, they look at it and they say, you are investing in me as a person in my time. You're taking your time out. It's, it's a different way of leading. It's not directoral. Um, it's not telling somebody what to do and then just expecting them to get it done. It's really investing your, your time and your services and who they are and that's a huge quality that, that I bring in terms of management. Uh, the other aspects is, you know, with that varied background. You learn a lot, you learn about strategy, you learn about conflict resolution, both between the customers that you have coming in the door as well as on the floor. I mean customer service departments and sales departments, they're full of personalities and you have to learn how to manage those conflicts and you certainly have to be able to keep a cool head. Um, over the course of my career, you know, I can think of 100 times where somebody has called me a name or taking a personal attack and you really have to take that step back and understand that they're frustrated about something or they're upset about something. And how do you work towards the solution rather than, you know, react viscerally and say, you know, no, I'm not. This is your fault. Things along those lines. So I think when you get into those aspects, they're they're really the top qualities of leadership and why it would be a fantastic candidate.",POSITIVE,0.5356,0.0042,0.4595,0.0007,945.0,MED,7,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),17.69,0,1,0,"Bachelor's degree (e.g. BA, BS)",Male,9.167149,8.88949,8.993532

Um I have a range of skills that I've honed over the past five years of management ah and leadership and I do consider that to be a difference between the two management being operational, whereas leadership is generally more strategic. So my leadership philosophy is based on three main pillars ah kindness, trust and agility. So I have spent, as I mentioned the past five years in leadership and management positions, honing these skills in a variety of countries from Australia to the UK and in a variety of different contexts, both private and public. Um I will speak briefly about the three pillars in the way that I envision I lived through those philosophies when it comes to compassion. I believe that that is the most crucial part when dealing with both clients and our own staff. No, my compassion approach to our own staff is obviously tempered by operational need, but I believe that people that feel happy, comfortable and trusted, perform the best and that is something that I've certainly learned when building a team. Quite recently, I was in a situation where I was able to build a team from scratch and I made my expectations clear, but I also made the freedom of the tank lee around dynamic working, they could work from where if they wanted all they needed, we were a results based organization that avoided presenteeism, I got universe, received universally good feedback on this approach. People felt trusted and able to perform their best um in terms of our adaptable approach, I think that is absolutely crucial in today's constantly shifting context, whether it's at regularly shifting funding context in the public realm or um the changing needs of our clients in the private this it's so crucial to be able to adapt both of those uh those changing needs throughout our sort of business year, both sorry, in the short term over our day to day, but also in the longer term over a 5 to 10 year horizon, the most crucial thing is to set a strategy over safe, a five year timeline time frame, but then also able to adapt it as you go forwards and then we come to agile, it's really crucial to be able to work in ways to take advantages of to take advantage of changes in society, changes in technology, uh huh. And not to be tied to tradition, I think it's important to learn from tradition, but also to learn when to do something else. And part of agility is also being comfortable with failure of your team because that means you're trying something as long as that means, you're trying something new and absolutely crucially that you take time to reflect on it. So huge. Part of agility is building in formal self reflection and both individually and as a team and this is an approach that I have used recently when building a team and our results were very positive in the first quarter, in which we are performed other um benchmarked teams across the sector. So Those three pillars are the things that inform my approach to leadership, and they are the ways in which I've applied them and found success so far. And that is why I think that I would be the best possible candidate for this position.

Yes. Hello. Um My name is Jason Williams and I believe that I would fit the managerial role quite well because I've spent a long time having to manage other people as um whether that be as the team leader in a group or um actually being a manager at store. Um I've I worked as a manager for two years in a shop in London. Um When I was in secondary school as well as a primary school, I would usually take the role of the leader of the group. Since I believed that under my leadership people would listen and understand what we need to be done or um I can allocate certain jobs to people who I believe would be able to complete them on time as well as um as well as efficiently and that um I believe that as a leader, I understand what what um it takes in order to sort people out into where they need to be as well as um well as well as deciding um if someone is good enough or not for a certain job. For example if two people were deciding to go for um the same sort of role and one of them was very reliable and was like oil on time and like always like did their jobs in a timely manner but the other one wasn't as reliable or wasn't as um like didn't do their jobs as well or they did it quite slack job. I feel like I would know my stuff well enough to um understand who is who actually puts the work in and put the effort in every single time instead of they're doing it now because they know that there's a position opening, oh they're doing it now because they think that they can get some sort of bonus out of it. And I believe the reason I'm so good at this is because I'm gonna observing people and noticing when they're doing well what they're doing when they're doing it well. So for example, um and when I worked in the store, um one of the main things I do is I look around, let's see who was like slacking or who was like um for example, if I thought someone to go and stock shelves, I would see how long it would take them compared to other people. For example, if it took them five minutes to stack 10 items on the shelf, clearly they've known been taking it seriously and they're purposely taking longer since obviously they don't want to do the job. And I believe that I would notice that and I wouldn't allow them to, we'll mess around or anything like that, and I'd obviously tell them, look, you're clearly not taking this seriously, you're clearly you clearly don't care, and I would um recommend them accordingly based on whatever it is, because obviously at the end of the day um when it comes down to it, it's me who um has to see all these people out and it's my job to make sure that people are doing what needs to be done in the store and what I'm like obviously everything works better when everyone is doing it together and if people are slacking and things like that it puts other people down and then they don't want to do it because as far as they're concerned, oh, Stephen isn't doing what he needs to do what Jeffrey isn't doing what he needs to do. So why should I do it? And I believe that keeping everyone motivated and doing what they need to do is the perfect way to obviously have been running successfully.",POSITIVE,0.5879,0.0046,0.4071,0.0004,624.0,HIGH,11,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),9.929999,0,1,0,"Associate degree (e.g. AA, AS)",Male,9.008526,8.730081,8.468145

However, I think it's probably worthwhile um outlining what I believe leadership to be, you know, what does the leader do and how is that different to a manager, for example? Well from my perspective a leader is somebody who encourages and uh inspires a team of individuals to achieve a common goal, that's what they do. So how how do I manage that process? Why do I think I'm effective in um getting my teams to do that? Well, I think you know, there's a couple of things that are really foundations uh for, you know how I operate as a leader, One is setting the direction okay, making sure that there's a very clear communication and understanding of what, you know what it is, we're trying to achieve visiting, but actually the journey is just as important as the destination. So actually how we do it, you know what the uh what the identity of the team is, you know what the what the culture of the team is very important. So for example, there are three main pillars um I always I always instill in my teams that are kind of non negotiables for me, right? And and the first pillar is to be insightful, so my teams are always uh consultative and insightful both internally and externally. That's an absolutely non negotiable for me, that's how I like to operate and that's how I like my teams to operate. The second is my teams get great results and strive to get great results again for our customers, but also internally very, very important. We do that. And third is that we are easy to work with again, both internally and externally. So, you know, if there's a team, you are very insightful and knowledgeable, if you get great results, if you're really easy to work with, generally you've got a good chance of being a successful team. So that's what I do. So we set the direction, we set the clear expectations. I think everyone in my team always understands the role they fulfill, but also within that kind of ethos, that culture of the team, most three pillars that I mentioned before, extremely important and um you know, the team members live and breathe those values um and therefore always um you know, working in uh two common purposes in in a very ethical, but aside from that, you know, what do I feel I bring to the team as a leader? Well, um you know, setting direction is really important and direction isn't just about telling someone what we have to do or giving a sales quote or giving a time deadline? Setting the direction is actually putting into context where we're going as an organization and specifically how that team and the individuals in the team contribute towards that. So what is the vision of the organization? Where is it going to go? And that involves um you know spending time with the executive leadership group too. Uh I understand that, but then take that information and distill it in very um simple and uh you know, unambiguous um language to the team members, actually understand where it is, we're going, it's a business, but what they're doing and how that is very important to achieving that. So it really helps with motivation and understanding the context behind what they do. Very important to me that I develop and nurture team. So one of the things I'm extremely proud of is, you know, I've worked with a lot of individuals over time too, develop their careers, you know, and and and by developing their careers in terms of giving them experience, in terms of giving them training etcetera, all in the context obviously of achieving those um you know, those those very important objectives, you know, the business is going into, I've seen a lot of people who worked with me really develop and take on um you know, much more significant roles and responsibilities, It's something that gives me a real kick, I think my team members now I've got their best interests at heart, which I do um and and to do that, you know, I work very closely as a mentor and a coach, so I will set aside Individual checking sessions every day of just 20 minutes with each team member just to see how things are going and longer one on one periods again on a weekly basis where we talk about their specific developments, put together personal development plans and so on. Very important to me that my team know that I've got their backs and I will help develop them and I think overall, you know, that enables us to create a very harmonious environment. I think people are in the team, understand the direction we're going in, you know, the uh, the unspoken ethos and rules of the team and that, you know, the team is one that develops and the leader has got their backs and will develop them and uh, you know, for me that's been successful throughout my leadership career so far.

This is around my extensive work history in management positions, by extensive work history, in terms of managing people, managing responsibilities, managing the affairs of delivering to a marketplace on the terms that the organization I represent what wishes to and ensuring that we operate within the boundaries of what a responsible operating entity is in the current economic and social environment. I mentioned to you that I had extensive history in terms of operating and management positions and that started from a very young age. So when I was a teenager working in literally fast food jobs, I always wanted to um stretch myself to show that I could be in the leadership position. So what do I mean by that, I would oftentimes to volunteer for roles where I could ah practice some of the leadership skills that were available, whether that would be something like a shift leader uh being maybe first or second most senior person working during that time period to coming all the way up to a management function where I might be responsible for opening a store, closing down the store. Certainly payroll cash management, all functions in that I took those skill sets with me to university and at university I honed them further, I had roles where I was hiring and firing people in a front desk situation. I would schedule resources, I would operate payroll and I would report to senior leadership in terms of how the function was progressing. Um Those skill sets attracted me to the business world in which I wanted to participate more in the management function and so I came out into an entry level position in one of the big accounting firms at the accounting firm. I progressed through various rankings uh in terms of demonstrating my capability, my ability to manage other people, my ability to commit to clients, my ability to operate with a commercial objective. Uh And um in a way that was in the best interests of the firm and also all stakeholders combined and so as a result of that, I was able to be promoted uh firstly to director in one of the big accounting firms and ultimately to partner um that came with a lot of responsibility and ah a track record that needed to be established in order to substantiate those promotions and that ascension. Uh Most recently I was poached in the marketplace from by a competing firm who had recognized that I was a skilled operator in uh the particular area where they were interested in expanding. They needed somebody who had demonstrated that they had been there, done that and we're very capable in terms of creating something when there was very little to start with and put a put a vision and a plan together and really drive that forward and so that's what I've been working on for the last six months actually, since I've joined that organization.

So previously I have three years of experience in the industry and I have worked in many different environments in many With speak with people who are learning the English language and managed teams and managed finances and being able to work constructively in a team previously. So for example, um in my first English teaching position was in Italy in 2019. And throughout the summer of 2019 I worked in English, in organizing english summer camps are for learning the english language of poet with italian Children. And in this position I was responsible for managing teams of 4 to 5 different english teachers because I was more or less organizing the camp and setting the timetable each day and organizing the finances of the camp and making sure that every tutor was paid successfully. And I believe that this kind of experience would um definitely complement um and also helped me succeed in a management position in this company because I had previous management experience in combination of this, I've also been working as an english teacher in spain in a state school and this was between september 2000 and 19 and May 2020. And in this position I was responsible for planning my own classes, delivering my own lessons and I was very much independent, working independently completely independently. I created all my resources from scratch, um rehearsed lessons and then presented the lessons myself and so I believe that this shows my ability to work independently and also plan effectively. And I believe that these are both skills which will be advantageous to me um in a management position in this company because I effectively don't need other people to tell me what to do, I can be very autonomous, I can create my own resources, set my own table, stay on top of my workload and essentially um and then dedicate my time to managing other people who may need um that kind of guidance and leadership instead. And lastly, I think that I, I've shown that I am passionate about the industry and passionate about the work that I do and I'm not just financially motivated. So for example, when I worked in Poland teaching Polish adolescence, I was volunteering and I volunteered for a summer throughout 2019, um schools in different locations throughout Poland and because I was volunteering, I was still working just as rigorously as I had when I was organizing summer camps in Italy and I was still, if not working more hours than I was in Italy, but I wasn't being paid. Um but so I believe that I still showed lots of enthusiasm for the job and I still did manage a team of polish Children or a group of polish Children and I managed to lead them effectively in um group activities and creating a presentation to deliver to the rest of the group. And so I believe this shows the time, not just applying for the management position because it's financially beneficial to me, but because I genuinely want people in the industry to succeed, I want them to deliver effective lessons and for the Children that we are teaching or all adults that we are teaching even to succeed and improve their english abilities. And I believe that I have the revive showing my ability in the past to create resources autonomously to be creative to lead people both both in teaching classes and managing summer camps. And I believe that all of these skills um collectively qualify me for a management position in the in the english language teaching industry. So I hope you will consider my application in light of my previous experience and also my future potential. And I look forward to discussing the matter further with you.

The first is organization, the second is communication skills and the third is initiative and passion, I'll talk about each of those in turn, firstly, organizational skills, organization and time management is a huge part of my life to give a few specific examples of that. I have daily to do this um where which include prioritization of tasks, what is most important to be done the next day and what is important but less important and I constantly monitor that and if new priorities come in or new tasks to do then I Reprioritize and that's that's that's the big thing I do, I do exactly the same for weekly to do lists and also monthly to do list as well and again I constantly update those to ensure that I am prioritizing the most important and urgent tasks. In addition to that whenever I set a goal or have a long term project um I regularly review progress um to ensure a if I'm on track and be if I'm not on track to how, how I can get back on track as quickly as possible, combining those things together. They really helped me with leadership and managing objectives. Both mine and my teams. The second is communication, I've got a number of attributes for communication. First of all, I'm a really good listener, secondly I'm a positive person and I do not like any form of negativity and the third thing is that I'm an emotionally calm person and if you put all those things together, those those things helped me build positive relationships with anyone, but especially in the workplace scenario. Um And when you have positive relationships, it's much easier to cope with the difficulties that projects will sometimes provide. And then the third thing is initiative. Whenever I do things, I'm an all or nothing type of person and I commit my everything to them, I'm always passionate about what I do and I drive things forward. I don't like to wait for other people to necessarily um do do things, I'd like to know where each person is with the allocated work, um whether they need any extra help or support to fulfill their responsibilities. Uh and I'd like to do that for everyone in the team so that you can measure progress and if necessary, you can spot difficulties way in advance rather than having to react at the last minute. So if you put all those three things together, the organization skills, the communication allowed attributes, and the initiative. If you combine those things together, you essentially get someone who builds positive relationships who monitors progress, who can spot problems quickly and put those problems right quickly and maintain momentum.

With regards to my leadership skills and abilities that I believe makes me a suitable candidate for this position. I would always begin with empathy. Uh the ability to understand somebody else's position, even if you don't agree with that. But being able to understand where they're coming from, walk a mile in their shoes will ensure a clear line of communication is established, which is crucial. Any failure to a team or an organization can always always be traced back to a breakdown in communication. Empathy is the antidote. It basically means you can ensure, you know, what your team needs to achieve their goals and your team understands what's required of them. Um and that's crucial really to getting the job done, helps maintain integrity to things like that. Empathy is distinct from sympathy and and that's where the next skill, objectivity comes into play, objectivity means you can maintain that distance that is required to give you the bigger picture, a broader, wider perspective that helps you prioritize tasks, prioritize resources and personnel um and and it helps maximize the potential of personnel as well. A lack of objectivity will bog you down and you know, when there's a difficult decision to be made, you're only going to make things worse unless you remain objective. So yes, empathy is great. But you also need to sort of maintain that distance, objectivity applied to self is quite crucial as well, Be aware of your limitations. It's really popular to say, I would never ask someone to do something, I wouldn't do myself. It's very noble, Great. But realistically you're going to have people on your team which going to be uniquely qualified to their role, more qualified than you in that sense for that role. So if you try and get stuck in lead from the front or anything like that, you're really only going to get in people's way and there's going to be a breakdown in sort of your goal setting and management and things like that. So yeah, be aware of your own limitations, make sure that you're not sort of ah being inappropriate with your allocation of time and resources there. Um But that's not to say you can't be considerate. I truly believe that you know, leaders eat last. So um when you are allocating those resources, it's because you want to make sure you're not leaving anyone high and dry, they're going to be able to do their best work. They've got everything they need before you look to yourself. And in that sense you will always sort of achieve things with the minimum amount of stress. I think anything that you know, any objective that's achieved with too much expenditure or human cost and things like that is essentially a pyrrhic victory. You leave yourself with no resources for the next objective. So you know that empathy, objectivity, awareness itself, those three combined. Well give you the skills that you need to get the job done.

My name is Ash. The answer to your question is quite simple as a businessman and a proprietor employing a number of staff. I possess a number of fabulous leadership skills. The first scale I possess is organizational and decision making skills. I need to be able to manage people and projects productively. Otherwise it's pointless being in business. Being in business means I need to make a profit and by being decisive contribute tremendously to our final goal, which to make a fantastic profit at the end of the year. Further more. I am very persuasive and I'm an excellent negotiator. So when I'm negotiating with companies and my suppliers for products to sell in my business, I need to negotiate negotiation as you might know, it's a skill which not everybody has. However, it can be developed and over the past few years I managed to do that. Then of course being a businessman, you cannot be stagnant. You need to be able to innovate and take your business to the next level. Otherwise your competitors will overtake you. As you can see from the radio. I am a pretty confident person. And self confidence means that as a leader, I am not afraid to take responsibility for anything. I do the first one to put my hand up and say I made a mistake of Indeed, however, I must tell you that I've never made a major blunder which has affected my company adversely. I think that is the mark of self confidence I have in myself and of course I'm self aware, I'm very confident in my abilities to recognize my limits. Of course, what I mean by that is that when I have issues which I cannot tackle, I do not hesitate to ask an expert in that field. I like to learn all the time, so I'm not scared of asking questions, two specialists or experts so that I can take my company to the next level. And of course when you've got staff the ability to motivate and inspire, it's very important. I of course want to maximize my employers potential.

And so in order for you to be able to do this, you've got to be able to basically communicate a good narrative, you've got to be a good storyteller, you've got to be able to cut your hearts and minds in the way you speak and the way you come across, we have lots of experience in the teaching sector, But you are that you're working in definitely helps in this, and that's how I think after working 20 years in teaching, the absolutely built another thing which I think is very important um as a as a manager and as a potential team leader or a leader in the in any sector is deeply sitting skills. I mean, in my experience I've found that too many people, what sort of positions of authority no longer that much or that's that much interesting listening. But um again, what I found in the experience I have had in leading departments in teaching is that you can you can use the same skills as methods are inquiry really, you can ask questions that you may not know the answer to yourself. Um it's an excellent way of building rapport with your numbers and it's something which, you know, obviously the teacher over the years, I've demonstrated with the good students and staff alike and I think it's very important that should be in in leading successfully. Mhm. And I think I'm a vital, mm hmm. Component of leadership skills in teaching in particular have been kids just being able to demonstrate itself in this founding ground in self management and say um it's important to communicate Um two people that you've got yourself understanding, but you know, the factors that have influenced you and have led you to being in the position that you're in, you know, where you're leading. So in practical terms it could mean that I'm willing to let go of ways that might import success in the past um but which now in different circumstances may not. Um and so you know, rather than sort of you know, the same sort of strategies all the time. Um so which brings me on to the next thing. I think the ability to leave authentically um is vital in a in a management leadership position, otherwise you are seeing found out and you know, if you're trying to be a um you know, version of you know someone else or you know, he ended up being a second rate version so well, you know, I've always gone into um work with them entirely to that you know, I want to be the best version that can and possibly of myself rather than um you know, another individual. Uh I think I think one of the reasons why this is important is that if you are faced with adversity which obviously you are going to be in leadership positions, you're relying on your own, we are instructed as your own beliefs and what you're doing is, you know, comes from within and he's not sort of copying you know other strategies which you know you're not you haven't got the full belief in them and and um you know there's favoring the whole um organization and income, those qualities.

I've been able to accomplish a lot of goals for various companies, especially in my past company list. So I was able to manage the programmers in the company, the visual and the growth that we have soon one of the saints or the leadership qualities that are usually put in place in order to achieve these goals. It is strategic thinking, which helps me to definitely look a vision of what I want to do. Articles I want to achieve in this company. Sure. I take my time and creates this vision for the company and this helps because it shows me or it helps me have a direction of what I'm trying to achieve and what I'm trying to go where I'm trying to eat these various programmers. So yes, first I crazed that and I make this vision, I show you to each and every one of them make it clear to them that we plan, I plan on hanging into achieve this school, how we're going to achieve this school. We're planning together. I planned it first. Then I bring my points to them that, okay, you're going to do this and you're going to do this and you're going to do this. What's that? I deliver it to them. We're going to achieve this vision and the challenges that we're going to have, we're trying to achieve this vision.

And it requires a lot of compassion and empathy at still trying to direct the official regardless of how do you feel. And then we have communication with the team and the workers and the programmers.

Uh The 10 qualities and skills that I've outlined as Um what what makes me a great leader personally. Um so I'm gonna outline what those 10 skills are for you and then proceed to go through a detailed explanation of what exactly they entail and um and what about them really contributes to being a great leader and I'm just gonna get through as many as I can with the allotted time I've got and I will Submitted to you free review. Um so starting off here the 10 skills that I've outlined to begin with integrity. Um The importance of integrity I think is is fairly obvious though. It may not be a metric necessarily in employee evaluations, evaluations, integrity is an essential leadership trait for for me as an individual and for the organization. Um It's especially important for top level executives who are charting the organization's course um Which makes it pretty imperative as a manager to exhibit the qualities of your direct superiors. Um And then moving on to the second trait is the ability to delegate. Um So being one of the core responsibilities of a leader in a management position. Um It can be a little tricky to delegate effectively. Um But the goal isn't just for me to free myself up, it's also too enable my team members and the people that are responsible for to grow to facilitate teamwork as well. Um And lead to better overall decision making within the group and I think the best leaders build trust with their employees through the ability to get to delegate. Um moving on to the third quality is just the ability to communicate. I mean it's pretty, pretty basic but it's so essential um effective leadership and communication are are you know just quintessentially intertwined. Um The best leaders are skilled communicators when it comes to you know transmitting information, inspiring others, coaching. Yeah it's it's all pretty uh pretty integral um with communication though comes along uh the ability to listen well, so to be able to hear the the concerns ideas et cetera of the people that you're responsible, responsible for. It is going to foster a work environment that is conducive to success, moving on here to um I believe the fourth trade that I outlined is self awareness. Um So while you know inherently it's a bit more of a inwardly focused straight um exhibiting self awareness to your colleagues is gonna build is going to humanize you, it's going to build trust and it's going to ah it's gonna communicate a sense of self accountability which I think is really important for your colleagues and the people you managed to see. Yeah The 5th trade I've got outlined here is gratitude. Um so being thankful for the work that your team is putting in um you know, you may have to get something done on an expedited basis. Um It's surprising how often people rarely say thank you in work settings and I think it needs to be a little bit more. I think the the sense of appreciative nous needs to needs to be a little bit more fluid uh six learning ability. So I think oftentimes people in managerial roles can get caught up in the fact that they are a manager. Um and they sometimes forget that it's still their responsibility to learn and grow even in positions like that. So um especially learning on the fly, if you if you need to adapt to a situation or a project that you know, comes across your desk, being able to learn and recognize that you may not have all the answers at the start is important and you know, your your subordinates are gonna are gonna recognize that you're putting in the work to adapt to situations and that you are recognizing that you don't know everything, It looks like. I've only got about 20 seconds left, so I'm gonna stop the outline there and just go ahead and thank you for the opportunity to to talk.

So when I'm going through something, it's looking outside the box being a history teacher, being a historian. You know, I'm constantly looking at sources, I'm constantly looking at the way things are working and what I do is I think I have to look at more than what I see on paper. Okay? So if I'm looking at when I'm managing people, it's sort of like what I'm going to help out and doing okay where there's a problem Ok, how can we fix it? Who's best to solve to fix that planning and delivery and making sure you plan something adequately, make sure that you deliver on what you plan to do. So in the time frame that it gets done, my best idea is to over plan. Okay, and then over deliver. Okay, I don't believe in planning and delivery. I like over planning and over delivering okay to make sure that it's sort of like an old attitude, I read once about, about an american sports coach. You know, you measure twice and cut once, but you make sure that you do everything that you preparation is always the way to go in the beginning. So prepare everything and plan everything out plan for scenarios, make sure you get it done and also planned before something is finished because you need to compensate for anything that might the microphone that will go wrong such as covid such as work stopping or supply problems or something like that. So over planning and over delivery, delivering it before time giving yourself that buffer. So if something does happen, you've got that work to do managing people is really, really important. One other thing I like to look at. Yeah, it's not just um working with people finding the right people in this work and find the right people and using them using their talents specifically. So if I'm if I'm telling someone to do something, you know, I want someone who's going to be passionate about that. I want someone who knows what they're doing in a specific role. I want to make sure that it happens that way. And the big way to do so is to be able to be able to change. Yeah, there's no one set management style that you can, you can go by different situations, different days, different ideas, different people, different tasks. You need to be different. You need to be adaptable. Have you can't adapt if you can't change your style. If you're set in your ways, you know, it's not gonna work basically you need to recognize and respond okay. Because if you can't change because in our world, in our business and our society, things are constantly changing. You know, we've got new ideas and new practices, we've got new technology, we've got new different differences coming in all the time. Okay, what might have worked five years ago is not going to work now. What works now is not going to work in the future. If you want to be alec unit, get their strategic thinking, what they're over planning over liver, you want to manage those people, you have to be able to change. If you can't change then you're in a lot of trouble then you're not going to do the right thing. You need to be able to communicate. Mhm. Written verbal communication, body language is important. Mhm. Talking through ideas, communicating ideas, putting ideas out there, taking and also bringing it back in. Not thinking that because I spoke just because I'm communicating with someone that this is my way to do it, this is what it's going to happen. Comes back to good management, people management, changing management, you have to be open to ideas. It's gonna be open to new ideas because I'm not always all right. I have my ideas, I have my ways of doing things. Someone brings up a better suggestion. Great, fantastic go with it. Very important, persuasion and influence. Okay, encouragement, helping people leading from the front is important in management style, don't send people to do things that you expect them to do, that. You won't do yourself as a manager. I'm expect myself to be the first person there and the last person to leave, expect everything to get done. And I will do it myself. I'll help out myself.

First and foremost, I have experience in management. I spent years managing um large groups of people and I believe that I have the ability to pull together teams and make things happen and I believe that's probably what you're looking for. So I used to manage about 40 people um and we did a variety of tasks. We had to pull together different teams to accomplish different tasks. So I'm used to um subdividing work ah specifically for my particular job right now. Um I I manage large amounts of people uh just uh in kind of a different way. So I have to manage about 140 people a day. and those 100 40 people have disparate attitudes and they have disparate ideas of of what working together really means. Some of them don't really want to work together. Uh So it's it's a task to get everybody on the same page and to get things happen when that occurs. So I wasn't given the option of what team I wanted to put together so that that that's what we're doing right now is making sure that the team is working together. So as a manager, I'm used to all phases of of management from hiring to terminating to training and everything in between training and promotion, you, you name it, I have had P. And L responsibility, profit and loss responsibility for years. So yeah, I think I also have the right personality for it. There's some managers that are very overbearing and there are some managers that are, that are very lackadaisical and I fall in the, I think I strike the right balance of that because you don't want your people hating you, you don't want your people hating to come to work, but at the same time you don't want your people off task. You don't want your people without a sense of urgency, without a sense of getting things done and accomplishing the tasks at hand. So striking the right balance to accomplish what needs to be done and at the same time keeping your people happy, that's really what it's all about. So in my opinion, I have that Um I spent about six years doing exactly that and we were quite successful with it. Um Nowadays, again, I think we're successful with my current position um but hopefully we can, we can move up the ladder and yeah, I think now is the time, now is the time. So I look forward to um to making that happen. Um I look forward to integrating with, with the team and with the company as a whole in the, in a new role and yeah, that would be great. So with that in mind, I guess I will say um I will say that I am a dedicated employee and my track record has shown that I'm extraordinarily dependable and I expect my people to be dependable as well. Now there's always things that come up in life where you have to accommodate things and I understand that again, the balance striking the right balance. So yeah, ah, striking the right balance with um making sure your people are getting the task done, making sure your people don't feel overworked. Um, even though there might be a lot of work to do. So creating and fostering an environment where people actually want to come to work, I think that's a big deal. So hopefully, um, I get the opportunity to, to provide that for you and I think I am the right choice for, for what you need.

I understand you wish to hear more about some of my previous management experience and the various leadership qualities that I possess. So let's get right into it, shall we? So previously I have worked as a team manager for an after school program. I managed about, I'd say anywhere between 13 and 17 people depending on people coming and going, hello, I organize schedules, I divided up labor for them and I was able to effectively lead them and guide their work so that they could best provide aid to Children during their touring time. We used the data driven approach which I was able to teach to the entire team and I'd say I was fairly successful. I listen to them. I listened to my team's needs. I was able to solve conflict, whether it be intra personal or something related. Two, any kind of conflict they might have had with the overall goal or our mission for the after school program, I've included reference for my time with this job.

Um, I would say that my seven plus years of this organization plus three or 4 in my previous role um, definitely gives me the experience. Two, sorry, not very good at this to be able to manage people successfully. Um The current team that manages six people has been for over seven years now. They are the installation crew for our design and brain shop. I also handle purchasing the gatekeeping. Um, so I am fully aware of all the materials in the shop, all of the goings on of all the jobs. Um, and then also specifically when and where they're being installed and by whom and how. Um, and making sure that that handles pretty seamlessly every day. Um, it can be a little bit challenging trying to manage the uh, lives of six people, especially when they all have families and uh, you know, hobbies and fun things going on that, you know, we're also gonna take up time especially with these days with, with the pandemic with, with Children being involved, there's been a lot of mandatory downtime or when people can't come in to work. And so that's been a bit of a challenge and a struggle to get through it. You know, we've, we've made it work as a team. Um, you know, partially by leaving. Um, but making sure that, you know, their needs are met and when something is asked of them to go above and beyond or something a little bit extra that they are, but that's recognized and if not monetarily compensated, then at least you know, maybe they get to go home early one day. Um You know paid or you know, we'll get an extra day off or buy him lunch or just something. Anything to try and make life a little bit nicer and easier for everybody to lower stress levels. Um Especially, you know, like having a little bit of turnover during, during the pandemic has been a challenge to. Sometimes we haven't been functioning on a full crew and I'm trying to make sure that everything is taken care of and that everybody's needs and then is even more difficult. Um But we've made it work and without any real issues or blow ups um everybody kind of pitches and helps out. I think that's, you know personally indicative of my my leadership style is making sure that um people's needs are met and that people are satisfied and happy because without that um you're not going to have a very good team or a team that's willing to go the extra mile for you or make sure that things get done. You know, they're going to be very much working on their own terms for themselves. Um uh There is some conflict resolution involved with that. Um Even though my team doesn't have many problems occasionally, especially we've had some issues with sales staff not properly documenting or giving information to lead to a successful installation and that has crossed some frustrations with people on occasion, which you can completely understand. Um ah mainly it just involves kind of talking to everybody and working everything through and making sure that, you know, even though a problem has occurred that having people understand that there's somebody on their side who is willing to help with that problem to make sure that it gets resolved and doesn't cause them for frustration or time delays or um you know, put them behind or anything. So we had some fun sit downs with sales field to make sure that that happened. We set some better expectations for the future, making sure that everybody going forward won't. You have to run into these issues. And I think that that's been very paying off very well for everyone. Um And I've definitely noticed that the installation staff has um I've been coming to me with fewer problems less regularly, so that's been really great. Um So all in all, I think really my leadership style is indicative of how my team functions and the problems that they don't have and trying to proactively take care of all that and make sure everybody's happy to take care of that.

Um I've had over 30 years experience leading small teams and also relatively large organizations. This has been in a number of industries. I started in local government, based around library museums, archives and heritage work. And in that kind of organization at that stage of my career I was the least experienced and certainly the youngest and I had to convince people who I had done things in a particular way for a long time sometimes because that was the only way that they knew it was the way always things had always been done and what I tried to do was convinced them of the reasons why changes should be introduced and tried to keep them on board through a number of changes to their working practices. It was like a government. I have worked for quite large corporate enterprises, including a global Company employing over 150,000 people in more than 80 countries around the world. And I was responsible for a research center providing information for the executives in any one of these business arenas around the globe. And here I was leading a much more um contemporaneous, a group of people who were much closer to my age, much closer to my educational standard. Um some of them much more experienced in the industry which we were working in and it was a key point for me to include them in any decision making to learn from their experience and possibly to revise what I was trying to um, the direction I was trying to take our part of the organization. This part of my career taught me the value of the bottom line and also the non tangible assets, for example, the people and their value to not only the bottom line, but um the reputation of the organization Later in general, I was the most experienced person in our team and at one I could almost be described as a world leader in the um in the work that we were doing. Um this was for a very large educational establishment, one of the most prestigious in the world, and I will project the project I was leading was involved in every Eu state and it was involved in running events. So not only did I have my own team to run, our team would then arrive in a new location and mold together a team of local people into a successful event and we delivered these events, hundreds of them across the european union, and as you can tell from my style, it it's much, much more collaborative than a directive style, but when you have such a short amount of time to bring a team together and get things done, sometimes you really do have to lead from the front, roll up your sleeves, show people how it's done and I hope that this range of skills will show you that I'm the best person for your new role.",POSITIVE,0.7141,0.0036,0.2807,0.0015,525.0,HIGH,11,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),7.81,0,1,0,"Master's degree (e.g. MA, MS, MEd)",Male,8.942682,9.262263,9.430751

So the way I go about managing, managing that team is to have an open mind and to kind of take on ideas from, you know, from everyone really to make sure that everyone's opinion is heard such that I'm not biased towards people who have mechanical engineers, not myself, I really do make an effort to make sure that I'm open to everyone. So one example I've got is of where I've had good leadership skills is ours, leading team on a large industrial project when we were designing and manufacturing several large pieces of heavy machinery. This involved that the whole spread of the team, different engineers. It was a really complex project and we were dealt with really strict time requirements. So the project, it was, it was going to be a stretch to complete it to sufficient quality within the right time requirements. So the way I approach this was to be kind of up front with the client. Initially I'd say this is, you know, the team we've got and therefore resources are limited and you're trying to get us to do this, this is quite complex projects in this time and I'm just trying to let them know that we've got only got certain resources. So the client was still pushing to get this project completed on time and the scope is still the same. So then my job really became trying to motivate the team to work really as efficiently as they could. Such that we did kind of get, you know, get as far as we could with the project in the time we had. So the way I did this was I kind of held regular 121 Check ins with every team member once a week, check in with and see you know how they were getting on if they're struggling and what problems they had. So then I could go and see if I could help, you know immediately with those problems or if I could in some way get another team member who might have a bit of availability to come and help them. And I found it really did, can I help the team push forward? Because it meant that people had less problems and therefore they could just crack on um quicker than they would have been able to do. Um and we did just get to the end of the project, completing it in the time that we had. So that was a big success. And you know in the debriefing afterwards several of my colleagues, I said that I had been really good, I'd help them towards being as efficient as they could and then um this kind of help get me noticed and after that hours and give a big attack some bigger projects to manage um Ever since then I've always had feedback that I'm really personal and people in my team can always come to me if they've got any problems. And so I think that leads to a kind of inclusive culture where everyone feels that their voices heard and therefore they kind of feel empowered to do what they can do to the best of their ability. And if you don't have any problems to come and talk to me, and so I think I'm a very good leader because I can get the best out of people.",NEUTRAL,0.3259,0.0369,0.6361,0.0011,613.0,LOW,6,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),8.24,0,1,0,"Master's degree (e.g. MA, MS, MEd)",Male,8.864529,9.182648,9.274412

And there are so many qualities needed for this and especially in a management position, it may come across at times as though I'm reading a list of obvious qualities, standard, kind of buzz speak, but these things I truly believe in and I'll try to not just say the things themselves, the quality of the abilities, but also give some actual examples of why they are important. So I think one of the most important things is the most important thing overall is to truly get to know everybody that you work with and for that means taking lots of time, patients to get to know people as humans, but also to see them work, listen to what they say, observe in a very, very sideways on manner, not observing a formal way, but understand how these people do what they do and what they do so well by knowing the strengths of everybody you work with, you would then find naturally that you have the ability to delegate because you know inside out what everybody brings to their role, the uniqueness of their strengths and how that can help everybody. And that naturally filters through to delegation, delegation of tasks, delegation of role mixing and matching a team to know the qualities that will blend so well together to achieve different aims, knowing that you are not the expert in everything you do not know the answers you seek just as much as everyone else to find the best solutions that is the ability to oversee, understand and realize how as a team you can achieve the best results. So it's not about do as I say, this is the way I am leading all the time, it's understanding, empathizing, realizing what everyone can do for the best encouragement of people you work with, encouraging not just to achieve the best in a cajoling way, but encouraging. It can be as simple as a very small. Thank you, I really like the way we did that, that's terrific What you did there. I can learn from two supporting and empathizing those that you work with and those that you work for taking again that time that patients to truly build up that understanding is crucial. Okay, if you want to truly lead and for others to respect you, you need to extol those values that you believe in yourself, you need to lead by example and that's by through doing what you do and again, people over time will you can't hide who you are, you can't hide those flaws as well as those strengths and people will quickly quickly pick up on those strengths and those floors, but it's having that confidence, that self belief to realize that as a human doing the best you can, as long as you can extol all those values truly to everybody else and for everything you do, you will gain that respect. People will understand you, people will want to be with you, people, we want to be led by you.

I have about 10 years experience in the back end programming with an expertise in PHP and python as well as you know, fundamental understanding of a lot of the basics, including things like databases, um service and all of that sort of thing as well as and some understanding of front end developers like html javascript CSS and the team that I manage is that I run is um Formula found of three backend developers and two front end developers.

Um So yes, I've been doing this, I've been a developer of 10 years, been lead developer for five years and I think I think I'm ready to take on sort of a more a more robust managerial role. Um So obviously development is one thing, but a huge part of management is actually dealing with people ah sarah sof, the two main two main pillars of this. One of them is managing the actual stuff and the other one is managing clients or stakeholders, I'd say I've got quite a lot of experience with with both of these, as I said at the lead developer role involves sort of managing the end, guiding a bunch of developers. Um but the, it also involves making sure that the things that we deliver our, what are required by by clients or by managers at the company itself.

I am, I also think it's important to be able to make tougher decisions as a manager to be able to, I daily, you know, no staff are going to need any kind of disciplinary action. I think it's useful to try and that stuff in the bud and make it makes the expectations clear ahead of saying, so we don't have any problems, but obviously sometimes these problems will come up and I think it's important to, to be fair, but if something isn't working, I also think it's important to recognize that and try and get try and deal with those sort of problems before it becomes too big of an issue. Um, it's important to me that people understand when they're walking down the wrong path and, and if they, and also it's a Not get them feeling too comfortable if they are in trouble and make it make it nine that something could go wrong. Oh, that you know that their job is in jeopardy, for instance, or something like that. And if someone is suspended, that they understand why, why they're suspended. Um, so yes, so to summarize, I think I have experience with dealing with staff and customers.

I'm applying for a manager job and I would uh like the first tell you about my previous history ah working especially in management positions back years ago I own my own business. And as a result of course I was a manager. In fact it was a manager of around 30 some odd employees the business I started ah I started earning in in the very beginning less than $100,000 a year. And when I completed my task as manager slash president of the company, It was earning well over one million and that was slightly under a decade later. As I said I managed a little over 30 some odd people. Part of my job was managing a photo lab and all the technical specifications that go along with that. Uh huh. After 10 years was made an offer by a large corporation that was in the same industry as me. I took the offer and decided to retire for a while. They actually paid me enough money that I was able to enjoy some life thereafter for a few years. Um Next. And probably my favorite ah managerial pursuit was that of a landfill. Actually working in the waste industry. I know that's odd to go from ah go from ah portraiture in owning a studio in a photo lab uh Two becoming a manager at a landfill, but that's what I did and I did and I didn't hire on in the beginning as a manager. I actually worked my way up the ladder relatively quickly uh to make manager. Uh I enjoyed the work and I think that's the reason why I became so involved. I specifically remember getting on google and reading everything I could about the waste industry, about land spill, landfill specifics and how it operates, how they operate. Excuse me. How trash decomposes uh life span of a landfill as well as one of the most important aspects. And that's of course the landfill creating methane gas, which can be a bad thing for the environment and it is regulated by the federal and state governments. As a result, we were lucky and that there was a brick plant not, but a few miles down the road from the landfill. And I got to thinking one day instead of burning off the methane gas, why not go and talk to the management of the brick plant because I knew that to fire their ovens to make brick, they had to have gas. I went down, talk to him, talked him into actually buying our methane gas, not only buying our cash But running a pipeline from their plant to our landfill, which was about two miles away At a cost of over $1 million dollars out of their pocket as a result of my endeavors and my efforts, they, the landfill itself decided that to make me a manager, in fact, the landfill manager of this particular facility, I started out at a very low wage hourly. and when I did retire from them about 15 years later, I was making brought over $100,000 a year salary.

Um I just wanted to cover several of the areas of myself as a candidate, which I believe make me an appropriate choice from management role um within the division stepping up from my current responsibilities. Um So firstly I'd just like to say that recently I've been the lead for several projects on the team which have involved various measures of stakeholder engagement as well as the formation and management of the team comprising of different, comprising different skills. Um So recently I led a project where I had to commission a team around and underneath me and lead from forward on a temporary basis. The project was a success and the outcomes and the outcomes we set out to achieve were achieved, which shows my ability to lead a team towards specific outcomes. I've always also been the direct point of contact for several external stakeholders, special advisers and ministers on various topics which engaged commissioning and evaluating different research products again, which shows my ability to um direct people from different teams and different departments towards um inform them of what we're doing in a certain area and leave them on a on a project where maybe they don't have the skills, the background of the skill set, but coming into the project as they've been new to it. Um On top of this, I've consistently been the first point of contact for several new members of the team. I believe this world demonstrates my ability to share information and lead others to towards successful outcomes. Often when new people join the team, they get partnered up with me for the first couple of months, I often of a start, it can be quite an intense period of conversation with myself, where I teach them the new ropes, but onwards, throughout their probation period of the first six months, I'm always very as a point of contact and always able to help people. This shows again my ability to lead others towards success within the, within the department, um, teaching them about things that they might not know about and and engaging them and making sure that they know everything they need to do their job successfully. I think this would leave me well towards managerial position where I can as it's proven that I'm good at good leading people. Um, I'm good at helping people, um, feedback from the team around me, people above me, people believe me and people at the same level as me has always been, consisted, has has always consistently included details of my ability to help colleagues familiar or familiarize themselves with unknown situations. Um, to several projects we've had, where newer members of the team have joined and maybe not had the knowledge of a particular area, maybe they haven't, maybe they haven't worked for us before or they're coming in from a different team on an ad hoc basis. Um, judge consistently when I've worked with these people and I've collected feedback from them. They've always praised me on an individual basis as someone who is really helpful in driving towards the common goals and helping, providing them with the information that they need to familiarize themselves with unknown situations and, more so, if you go to contact on several policy issues um for colleagues, on other teams and in other departments on an ad hoc basis, this demonstrates, I believe, but I'm easy to approach and knowledgeable and lots of different areas, the fact that different people from different policy areas come to me first.

I recently graduated from the University of Cape Town with a bachelor's in economics and finance. So I have an economic history of studying the area of work which you have here abc company to give a bit of background in terms of leadership. Mm hmm. To start off, just in my life, I've been finding myself in management position since a very young age in high school. I was one of the predominant academic mentors for my high school. And that role basically encompass just teaching the lower grades and helping them in mathematics, physics, all the sciences and other topics that they would come to us for this. Then extended while I was doing my academic work at the tertiary level at the University of Cape Town. While I was studying, I would often take or strive to take the leadership positions in whatever group work that we had going on. And in university there were many group for projects. I I always felt a strong affiliation and strong alliance with taking on those leadership and management roles in ensuring that the group that I was managing was meeting deadlines, keeping on schedule and working in efficient ways. Um and I am happy to say that we managed to get very good grades to back that up and perhaps be it's personal testament to my efficiency in management, some other management skills that I believe would be perfect for this position here at abc company. I'm first and foremost an extremely effective communicator. I'm able to get across seemingly very complicated topics, very concisely and without too much dilly dallying and flowery words. I believe that I can communicate issues and manage them effectively without having any confusion. I'm also very empathic person, which I believe is one of the most important skills for management, I think, understanding what or the people who you are managing skills, strengths and weaknesses and utilizing those pointing them towards the role that they would be best suited for in projects and things like that. Um I believe is a quintessential skill for any management position. However, I do believe that there is an importance in still maintaining some sort of boundary between the management position and the workers around them. I feel like empathy can also lead to negligence in some case or possibly not allowing yourself to be as direct or forward, especially when mistakes happen, which they eventually do. So I believe that I can still keep a boundary and understand what my role is and what I need to do without empathy coming in the way of them, I'm capable of keeping things on track. I don't mind the occasional brainstorms and things like that. However, when it gets to a certain point, I am very, very good at keeping things back onto the train tracks and making sure that we're not just wasting time for, especially the important individuals who are lending us their time for such projects. Um yeah, a brief overview of what I would consider my best skills, as I mentioned before my empathy, the ability to keep individuals on track. I'm also very, very able to resist pressure. I'm able to manage things under pressure and I will not cave if there are stricter deadlines or things have to be moved here and then I believe that I can handle a lot of projects at the same time, we manage them effectively. What I would say would be maybe the biggest weakness is ingenuity or not being genuine. Rather, I believe that I can only really participate projects that I am personally passionate about.

I also want to speak of what my management style would be like. I'm a very team and goal oriented um person. I also think that um excellent leadership means to be able to bring forward some to bring out the strongest qualities out of the team members. Um part of that is using the team to their strengths but also to understand and accept the weaknesses that some of these team members may bring, working with them and understanding why these weakness, why they have these weaknesses and how to turn them into stronger points. Whether that is to work through some development plans, whether it is to have them shadow with a team member that is stronger in an area that they are weaker. I think that uplifting the entire team will make the individual manager a more successful person.

I think that I've also learned from the managers that I have, there's a time to step in and help your team and really manage the issues. There's also a time to give your team members of their autonomy to make their own mistakes, to also learn from their mistakes which would then make them a better person. Um all these qualities I've learned from and I've learned from others, which I think makes me a very, very strong candidate for the management position. I also feel that it's a natural progression from where I've been and will also make me, wow a more qualified or more qualified candidate than someone from the outside. Also bring a lot of knowledge within, organized, from within our organization that is invaluable in hiring any candidate.

Hello, thank you for speaking to me today about the manager position. Uh So a little bit about me, my name is Mark and I have certainly been in a managerial position before. In fact it's basically what I've been doing for my career for the last uh 11, 12 years. So before this I was editor in chief of backstage magazine and oversaw a staff of 12 and about 7-8 freelancers and contract employees. And I left that company to join Playbill where I was editor in chief for four years and oversaw a staff of about 15 and then 4-5 contract employees as well. So certainly I am well aware of all of the ups and downs of managing a team, especially in publishing and in the arts as a lot of big personalities that you have to navigate, which I'm fairly adept at. I have to say I will pat myself on the back for that. But one of the things that I think is a strength for me is I started off on the staff, I was managed a lot. I had some good managers, I have some very bad managers and so I have a real sense of what employees respond to in a manager. So one of the things that I make it a point to let everyone know is I've never asked an employee to do anything that I have not done myself. I don't think it's fair that I expect someone to do something when I myself do not understand the time requirement, the layout of energy. So anything that I assign it is something that I've done, whether that's weekend duty or copy editing someone else's story. These are all things that I understand and I know exactly what I'm asking. And then another thing that I have found really helpful as a manager is acknowledging when insane requests come from above. There is nothing worse than a manager gaslighting you into thinking that all of this is normal. All you have to do is tell your staff. Look, I understand this seems like a very bizarre, outrageous request. However, our hands are tied. The man who pays the bills is asking us to do this. So let's just smile and do it and then we won't waste any more time arguing about this. I think as long as your employees know that you are focused on them and you're all in the same boat, you get a lot more loyalty out of them. It makes it more fun place to work. Uh, certainly they don't dread coming to you with issues. That's one of the worst things that I can think of. I always want my employees to make sure that they are welcome to come into my office to chit chat or to let me know if there are issues that are coming up at Playbill. There were a lot of big personalities and there were a lot of times when I had to intervene between two employees who were perhaps not getting on, but with a base of mutual respect and them understanding that I'm seeing a bigger picture than they are. It was resolved fairly quickly and fairly innocently. So that was relief. Uh but that's kind of my managerial style. I I try to be friendly, I try to be very approachable, but I also need them to understand that at the end of the day, they are welcome to weigh in on decisions, but the final decision is mine and mine alone. And I think that they respect that more. It's a democracy up until the point at which point it very much becomes a dictatorship and hopefully a benign one, but I don't know, it depends on who you ask. But yes, so I'm definitely well versed in managing people. I have a good track record with it. My employee retention is extremely high uh even though I would prefer if everyone stayed for two years and then found better jobs if they were unable to grow with the company. Uh certainly that's a huge part of my managerial style as well, making sure that I'm mentoring my employees so that they are not stagnant in their careers. I don't want anybody to spend too long in the job. If there's no room for growth at this company, let me help you get a job somewhere else because that you don't get good work from people who feel stuck and who feels that there is no room for growth. So I just want to know what the best for all of us. Honestly.

I have the ability to rally employees together, working effectively as a team as a cohesive team. Um I can manage projects effectively from inception to completion, I can manage stakeholder expectations and also negotiate difficult propositions. My history includes many positions I've had as a manager, how excellent negotiation skills, team working skills and leadership qualities almost so heavily invested in my learning uh on self development or take ownership of development myself as an effective leader as much as possible. I can communicate to a large audience an audience which I haven't seen before in a wide range of interesting topics ranging from culture transformation, negotiation, digital and employee relations. So I will have a wide range of subject matter that I can talk about, have a wide interest in terms of reading as well, often reading in many subjects with his philosophy, medicine, religion, politics and ethics, just to name a few. Um I'm always extending my personal network of professionals learning from other professionals in my specific field and also asking them questions if I have quiet a personal difficult situation, whether it be a work or a personal situation and also looking at people in senior leadership positions and also replicating some of their success.

Our new ventures on the projects and I also know how to mitigate risk as well. Then we went to put a stop to a project if it's ruining over budget over time and it's costing too much resources, so have the foresight as well, so knowing how to run project is effectively knowing how to manage stakeholders and then we went to effectively pull out our project if it doesn't complete on time. I think these are effective. Being effective leader encompasses many facets ah of being an effective leader. I feel like I'm a all around person, excellent communication skills, excellent people, people skills, excellent problem solving, having foresight and insight skills and also being able to motivate and navigate through difficult and challenging economic climates as we are in a difficult common at the moment, have the ability to reach out to people and develop new opportunities.

So for me personally, I actually have done this multiple times over the many years, I've been working, one of the big things is like I said, being honest and open if there's an issue and raise it straight away and I've done this multiple times. So for example, in my recent role there was a issue where a member of the team wasn't communicating correctly with the client. So I pulled him aside, explained what they were doing wrong and I was very open and honest with how they should approach it. So instead of being like you've done this wrong, change it. I was more there to support them and allow them to develop further, which I think is another really big part of being a manager and being able to ensure that you get the best candidates possible and you make sure they achieve their goals in the long term. Another big thing I think is required when you're thinking about becoming a manager, it's been able to be assertive when needed. So sometimes there might be an issue of race where you have to pull someone aside and you might have to terminate their contract and you need to be direct and straightforward with that. And I feel like a lot of people don't really see the implications that could have on your mental health. I feel like you need to be assertive, you need to be straight to the point and you just be able to move on from it and for me personally, I've actually had to deal with that myself many many times and it is very sad and it is hard to do at times, but once you get the hang of it and once you understand it's for the benefit of the company you're all here to work and everyone's gonna do them only equal share. Everyone is willing to understand and be brutally honest with it really. So yeah, I also think you need to have really good admin skills. For example, if timber isn't in or there isn't enough resources, you need to be able to pick up their workload massively and in doing so you would actually take their workload off them, which means that you could impact would be at the same level as them even though you're actually are higher, but you need that skills just in case that ever does happen, it probably won't happen every single week or every single month. But it's good to have the skills but when you really need it really. It's one of those things that you don't really know you're going to need it until it comes up. So it's good to have that kind of leadership skills really. So the reason I actually think I'm the best candidate for this position is I'm open, I'm honest, I'm friendly, I've actually got experience to show my knowledge and how I've actually achieved my goals over the past X amount of years. I feel like anybody who's going for a role like this needs to know their strengths and weaknesses, which I do. I am very assertive, I'm very honest, open and overall I'm just a very nice person to be around. I'm very motivating to the staff. For example, if someone's having a bad day, I reach out with them, check what's up with them and just kind of like, like have a bit of a friendly relationship but still keep professional. And for me personally, I think that's what really works well. You've got to have that kind of relationship where you are friendly, you do know them on a personal level, but you're still getting the work done and the task at hand is going to get completely. And no matter what, I think that's a big thing for me personally, I think as someone who was once a standard employee who was under people, I didn't really have that friendly relationship and that kind of did make me feel a bit like an outcast. So I think for anyone you need to have that kind of mindset and for that reason, I think that's why I am the best candidate, really, A lot of people don't really see it that way. They just think, oh, I'll be a manager and I'll do this, I'll do that. But they don't see the wider picture and they don't see that you need to have a friendly relationship, You need to increase morale, motivation and just be able to reach out to them indirectly and just have a chat with them. It really goes a long way, and a lot of people don't really see that, you know, I just think when it comes down to the whole management side, you do need to have a good team who won't be scared to say anything, and they will be able to reach out to you no matter what you say, and if you make a mistake, they will tell you what you've done wrong, and you've got to be able to take it on the chin as well as you do it to them as well.

Not only because I'm experiencing that role, but merely because I've always put it all in the title of being manager, being a manager doesn't just mean you oversee everything and maintain the function of a company or enterprise. It means that you have to look out for your employees best interests and make sure they're teaching that they're reaching their daily targets. Being a manager consists of someone that is capable of uplifting the mood and spreads of employees as well as customers in a manner, which brings in a great profit turnover. When my part of my structure within an enterprise is to make sure that no matter what he that even even that even on our worst days we still have a profit turnover. I never want a single day or week to end with us in in a loss. That's what I feel brings it a good manager, that's what I feel makes a good manager. But on top of that a good manager is someone that can bring out the best in everyone around them and make everyone feel comfortable and confident in themselves and their work ethic, output is one of the most important things to me when in a workspace, because output says a lot about a person and if I see that a person is doing what I will give them an incentive. One of the few things I'll integrate is a system where the employees with the highest output get some sort of incentive. But one that they will be that they will be fine. We're working towards. Another thing I would consider looking to is organizing team building workshops. So the team being, the employees build a better relationship together so that they can work at a great rate as well as the fact that it will boost profit margins due to the sharpening and learning of new skills. Being a manager as a manager, you're not supposed to be little others. Yes, I will let my employees or those below me know that there's a hierarchy, but I'll always make sure that they feel as if they've also got to see, I won't let them feel like they're in the same place as me or the same place as me, but I'll make sure that they feel as if there's a sense of they can speak out, they don't have to hold their breath around me, they don't have to keep things in so I will integrate that furthermore.

I do believe you need to have very fine leadership skills because in order to lead a team, you need to be able to converse with them and talk with them. I have had prior experience as a manager. Ah and I also was the captain of my cross country team. I have plenty of experience working with people, either people such as customers or coworkers that might be in the business with me as manager. It is important to not only just make sure the ship doesn't sink, but also make sure everyone is doing their job, but on top of that, doing your own job as well, just because your manager doesn't mean you just get to tell everyone else what to do and how to do it. Being a leader and being somebody that people can look up to is being a role model. So being a manager isn't just shoving off all your work on someone else. Just like being a leader isn't just letting someone else do all your work for you and just being like a figurehead or an image for people to look towards when something goes wrong. Being a manager pretty much just means doing your normal work that all your co workers do with more on top of it. Whether that means scheduling, talking to customers, dealing with people who can't come in that day or whatever it might entail. Um being a manager means when no one is doing work, you should be the first one hopping on working and then saying, hey guys, you should jump on this with me being a leader is also just being something to follow. You know, being an idea to follow many managers nowadays, at least in my experience at other jobs, they tend to think that they're above everyone else that they, since they get paid more, they have more power, They have more, say they don't have to try as hard, but being a manager is way more than just being a leader. It's also being a very important cog in the system without you pretty much running the show, people may not know how to do things or maybe not how to do things right? Such as working in a restaurant. If you have any new hires that come in, if no one teaches them the right way how to do things, there's gonna be some problems and not just with them creating or them managing whatever work is tasked to them, but also other coworkers who might try harder than they do, they might get upset and they might get demotivated so your job as manager is to pretty much go around and put out fires, keep people from getting too frustrated or getting too overworked. Being a manager is looking at every single aspect of the business that you're part of and seeing how you can improve every area, although you may not own the business, Your job is to make sure that the business does as well as it can every day and run as efficiently as it can every day. Taking advantage of just being paid hourly or through salary is not something that a manager does. You're not supposed to be there just to sit around and do nothing, you're supposed to be there so that everyone around you could go maybe if I work as hard as him I could get that position one day because let's face it, a lot of people change jobs and one day the manager position might open up. My goal is to be here as long as I can and to do as much improvement or even just keep things efficient and as productive as possible at your business. Um If you lay your trust within me and decide to hire me as a manager, I promise you will not be disappointed in my work. I work as hard as I can. I put 100% effort into everything that I do and I refuse to let anyone tell me that you know, I don't need to do something. I mean if I'm part of your business and you bring me on with the promise that I'm going to work as hard as I can, that's what you're going to see, I'm not gonna sit on my phone or I'm not gonna jump on somebody else for not doing enough work, I'm going to focus on my work and when somebody is either causing an issue or just not putting in as much effort, I'll kindly walk up to them or just nudge them and say, hey man, I'd really appreciate if you could do this, it would be really helpful to me and all your coworkers and then we could just get through our day and at the end of our shift we can go home and feel proud of ourselves.

Um I think the starting point really from my point perspective is that a leader needs to be adaptable. I think the leader needs to be aware of the situation environment they find themselves in and then based on that they should be able to adapt the kind of styles that they use. Um I think also it's really really important that the leader actually provides the kind of environment where fellow workers or colleagues can thrive and excel. Um throughout my time as a leader or a manager and within my own organization I've always tried to provide an environment of what I call autonomy support where um I set the conditions to enable colleagues and employees to thrive uh and to in effect developed their own kind of way forward. Um In terms of my own kind of qualities, I think my own kind of ability and my kind of leadership start is I'm really really quite relaxed, I'm really, really quite calm in different situations. I believe that I am a good and effective communicator. Um I always take time to listen to staff. Uh and then based on that, I feel that I'm always kind kind of kind of supportive um as a leader, I have always tried to have an open door policy where staff can come to me with any issue whether it's work related or whether it's personal. Um I feel that's very very important that you actually as a leader, you take an interest in colleagues and employees not only at the work level, but to ensure that, you know in a press McCullers level, that you have a really, really good kind of sound relationship with them. I think there is also in that kind of respect. I think there is a distinction between your your your professional kind of leadership role and you're kind of social kind of leadership role. I've always tried to maintain more of a professional kind of approach when working with fellow colleagues and employees. Um I think another kind of perspective that is really, really important is quality um that everybody who relies on you within that kind of leadership kind of management kind of role. I understand that you treat them fair, you treat them equal um and you do not discriminate against anybody um based on the kind of prejudice or your kind of um individual kind of police. Um in terms of the role that I, my work I wrote um I work within an education. Um so I lead a team of about 14 full time employees and for part time um staff. Um So not only am I involved in actually um you know, leading that kind of kind of group, I also have responsibility for students from all different ages and all different abilities. Um So from that kind of perspective, I have also organizational kind of needs and organizational kind of demands and expectations of myself as a leader to ensure that policies, practices and procedures are carried out to the requirements of the organization. Sometimes that causes conflict sometimes that causes conflict between employees and staff and organizational needs. And I've always felt that actually within my kind of road middle management, I am really looking at the kind of go between really, I'm like the the safety kind of net between organizational demands and employees demands and ultimately the customers, the student kind of demands um as such. Um so in effect I ensure, I believe that I am quite democratic, kind of a leader. I do take onboard people's concerns. I listen very, very carefully to people's concerns not only from like management perspective, but also from a senior management, effective organizational demands kind of expected. Um I feel that I've been successful in my career in terms of leadership, I feel that I have got the respect not only from individual staff members, but also from seeing senior managers who will come to me for advice and guidance on a variety of different kind of issues.

Thanks for taking the time to see me and for the interview um I would like to first talk a little bit about some of the skills and the attributes that I have that would make me a good candidate for um this captain's position within the fire department. The first is the ability to make decisions quickly. We respond on all types of calls, whether it's fire calls, medical calls, car accidents, what have you and one of the worst things you do it you can do in my opinion is to get what some people call analysis. Paralysis is the inability to make a decision quickly and move towards move towards that. I believe that the best thing you can do is whether you feel like you're right wrong or indifferent is to make a decision and go with it. You can always re evaluate based on further information, change your plan, but it's super important to just get moving, get started, get working, get something done because a lot of the stuff that we do time is of the essence, these people, these patients, people folks, they need to be treated triage, they need to get to the hospital as quickly as possible. One of the other big qualities that I believe is important is the importance to back up your team members as a captain within this department. I would be directly supervising two other employees either on an engine crew or a ladder crew and they need to know that you have their back. They need to know that when they make decisions that are rooted in good fundamentals rooted in their training, that you will take care of them and not leave them hanging out to dry. Another big thing too is realizing that you don't know everything. Being open to suggestions. We call it you or you might call it like if you see something say something, I am not the end all be all while I am would technically be in charge. It's not a monarchy. This is a democracy. If you see something, you need to say something. If it's whether it's regarding the patient, whether it's regarding scene safety, whether or not you have a different idea, a different outlook, a different way to do something. I'm open. I'm open to whatever and a good manager needs to be open to that. It's super important in order to develop that crew continuity and to also provide the best service to the public that we can provide. I also believe it's really important to lead By example. I try to show up to work every day early on time, ready to go means the night before you go to bed early. Um, you're eating healthy. You're taking the time on duty to work out. You're keeping yourself in good physical shape, good mental shape. Uh, so that you can serve the citizens to the best of your ability and I believe that also sets a great example for, for the folks that you're managing. They need to see that they need to understand that, that you're holding yourself to a higher standard. And a lot of it also, I think we need to learn how to have fun. A lot of stuff that we see on a day in day out basis is not pretty, it's um gruesome and it can be bloody and it can be super sad and stressful and depressing and you need to have some sort of outlet. You need to try to have fun. We will do that.

I was, I felt upon myself to actually take up the mantle to volunteer myself for the presidential candidacy, which I was elected to do. So I took the initiative to write down some steps of what I wanted to do. One thing I wanted to do was I wanted to increase their staff when I increase the membership and then I want to increase our public knowledge of the club and the first thing I did was I pretty much introduced several policies into the club with the help of some interviews I had with some of our current as well as some of my other colleagues that were not part of the club, of what they wanted to see in a club itself. I use their information and applied it towards the club where we gain at least about 20, additional membership with that. So I felt comfortable with that goal as well as a lot of people in the club felt confident about being part of the close since they were getting something out of it where we, beforehand, it was just several field trips like the zoo or the park and that was it. The other thing that I wanted to do was create public knowledge and awareness of why our club is special. We decided to do a wow a volunteer, a charity volunteer where our club, we're working with other clubs to raise money for a cancer society, the breast cancer institutes. Our club was the one that founded the charity when this charity was founded, the, they are the events and since we were the one that was finding everything, we, I communicated with the other presidents in the science community, the chemistry club, the physics club, the nursing club and I even went out and branched into other um, clubs that were not particularly science based, which was pretty much the, the cost playing the JAPAn club because we were doing a Halloween party where we're going to raise money where all the emissions for the Halloween event was going to go directly towards brands Cancer Foundation. Um, again, No one wanted to step up to be the event coordinator or asked for donations or even organize anything. So I took it upon myself to do it and I helped dedicate certain tasks and DVD along with my vice president, there are people in my staff, even with other people and the other groups to pretty much make it a little bit easier, more conductive. So that way we were able to have a very successful events. Uh if memory serves me correct. We had about 150 200 students in the event and we raised about almost $800 for the breast cancer Foundation charity. So I believe that it was a very successful event. This experience helped me and shaping what type of leader I wanted to be, which is a little bit passive, but I was very active to make sure that people knew exactly where they needed to go, what they needed to do. And we did not even have a single negative interaction where everything went pretty much easy going. That's the manager, I want beep. And I believe that with the expenses that I had for that event, along with the other experiences that I had when I was a manager at a Halloween store, which during a stressful time of the year for Halloween, and we're able to make the best sales for that year. Those events, I believe war and qualified to be a manager and be able to take charge and everything that needs to be for the tasks.

The first and foremost is I do have leadership experience. I am quite young compared to anyone outside this organization. Um, but I do have that experience and I've proven time and time again that I've been effective in leadership roles. I started when I did a volunteer mission trip, but during that time I took on leadership roles quite early on in my experience and every time I was in a role, um I saw great results and kept on again moved up and higher higher roles. Uh after that, once I got into university, I was constantly put in leadership roles throughout university. Throughout high school, I took upon myself to be in student council and take on leadership roles there too. Finally, once I got into the workforce, my very first job, I was already in a role where I had to plan different events, manage different staff, manage groups of volunteers, chair a large events then that would throughout the span of event, would have tens of thousands of people attend and various things like that. And so I have the knowledge and experience that go along with leadership with that. I think I just have a natural leadership tendencies as part of my capabilities. I do have, I took a leadership class in university. Um it was combined with this group, world class and the whole point of it is, you're supposed to be doing these labs and in that lab, you you're supposed to be working together as a team and literally we know we're being observed quite quite good detail the entire time, I found that during the this lab portion that I was doing, one of the things we're looking for is who naturally took on a leadership role, I wasn't trying to take that class too seriously, but after a little bit I just felt the need to stand stand up and sure enough when the observation results were shared with us, they stated how I clearly stepped up to be a leader for my group. One of the things I wasn't trying to do, I was actually actively trying to take a step back during that time, I didn't want to dominate, but it's just part of who I am, it's in, it's in my DNA there and so I enjoy that. I also just enjoyed the challenge that comes with uh with the leadership responsibilities for me personally, I I do enjoy doing the work, but I also like being a part of the team and in particular I like the roles and responsibilities that come with leader. I have no issues getting my hands dirty, you know, working amongst the team, but I also know that there's certain times where delegation is needed um and just more traditional leadership qualities are needed, where you get your strongest team members to take certain parts at the same time. I consider myself quite a confident person even though I may not be the most experienced in a lot of areas, the most knowledgeable, I still consider myself one more confident people would ever meet? And so with that there, even though I may not have as much of um the competencies that other people are looking for, I do have the confidence to take me there. One of my old bosses state it really good. He, when he was looking to hire somebody and ultimately hired me, he said he wasn't looking so much for somebody that had all the right skills, He was looking for someone that had the right attitude, someone that he felt like he'd grow into that position. And so regardless of what the managerial position would be put in, I believe I have the right um groundwork put into place that I can learn that other additional skills that are needed, that's another area have been really good at my whole life is just adapting as needed in my life. I consider myself a very adaptable person, but also a very resilient person. A part of leadership is that it seems like nothing can ever go right consistently. There's always gonna be a little hiccups, areas that you're going to need to step up or to change your plan a little bit and that's where I can come into play here. Um I instead of, you know, when the first sign of something going wrong because I've just given up and having yourself a little pity party, I take the time to take a step back for a moment, take a breath and say, okay, what's next? What can I be doing different? How can I be using my team? And I think that resilience is another skill I have that would be beneficial um, to, to the larger team and and to the smaller teams I would be leading anyways.

Hi there um I am here to talk to you a little bit about leadership and why I am in this particular scenario for your research. I feel that I would be good for a managerial position and why I would exhibit certain leadership traits. So yeah, happy to talk to you about that. So um I actually just jotted down eight reasons in my notes, but I can walk through. So first of all it comes without saying, but experience managing people in the past, I think anyone who goes into manage management for the first time, they might have certain initial thoughts about what that would involve. But I think there's nothing that pizza, you know, a firm set of years of practice with various types of teams, a whole series of different types of personalities. Um you know, people management is a whole other ballgame compared to a more specialist kind of skill set that people might be more familiar with. And I think people also need to be aware that when they do go into management position, a lot of what their previous job may have entailed in terms of sectoral um expertise. Some of that may, if you're not careful, be a bit more distant and you'll find yourself embroiled in a lot more considerations around around people management and it doesn't always have to be that way, but it's just something that people need to keep in mind when they go into management. So anyway, I've had, I've had 10 years now of managing various teams. So that's something I'm familiar with um to work my way up within my particular industry. So I think that allows for a certain amount of respect in the team because people know that I've done their jobs and I know what their jobs are like, I know what they go through. Um I know the obstacles that they have to uh experience and that makes it easier for me to then in turn help them and understand their position three, not just, oh yes, not just outcomes, but process. What I mean by that is uh from a professional development standpoint, I take that area of their work very seriously in terms of people's professional professional growth and I don't just look at the outcomes of their deliverables on a quarterly or annual basis. What I do is I I mean companies and organizations, they take various risks. Employers should not be held accountable necessarily to the outcomes if the process itself was valid, if there, if the way that they approached a problem was valid, you still might end up with a negative result through no fault of of the of that particular employee. So I keep that in mind and reviews and I make sure that I focus a lot more on the process, how they actually went about doing something rather than what the the ultimate result was for. I offer many stretch opportunities to staff because I was always personally very um eager to to grow and stretch my position and actually the times when I left my, when I left rolls, it wasn't because the work wasn't interesting, but it was because I didn't feel like I was growing um myself. So what I make sure is that the team that I manage is always um feeling that they can try out new things, they can That they can take on new responsibilities and that that I have a level of trust in them to be able to do that. So I give them that space roughly, about 10% of their job have to always entertain those sorts of things. Um five I bring about a positive atmosphere um in the office that's always really important. People have to enjoy their work. It's eight hours a day when you add that up over a year, we're talking weeks or months straight of people's lives, so they need to be able to enjoy themselves, but of course also keeping up certain boundaries to make sure that there's an understood relationship there for a foundation of trust um for sake of time. I'll move quickly on though. I'm also really six. I'm really careful with hiring. That's actually the most important decision a manager can make if you hire the right staff and you're very rigorous in that process, everything will become easier after the result. seven I help with prioritization. So I'm always on hand to help people sift through the huge numbers of pieces of work that they have and I can help them um prioritize and decide which ones to uh, to not to hone in on and which ones to knock off and Um, that can give people space seven um, actually ate rather, I roll up my sleeves, so I'm very happy to do work as well. I don't just delegate, I'm happy to swoop in if people do need the support. I hope that's helpful.

I worked with an operating with excuse me, an opera of company touring, but then kind of moved on and left the city down in north Carolina. Ultimately ended up shifting gears entirely and I joined the navy was commissioned as an officer and became a surface warfare officer. Um, I spent most of my time in on ships of varying types, all small ships, frigates, destroyers, cruisers, that type of thing.

Ultimately, my last was my last assignment was commanding officer of a reserve center in in texas where I was running the center that trained uh kind of a mobile hospital mash unit, reserve unit that would have been deployed in times of crisis. Um, so there were several 100 people for whom I was responsible for that command. I retired after that went to Prudential financial uh in florida and um Became a technician. There really was hired on as a temp and learned in T4 from scratch on my own. I did the did the courses uh took the tests, became certified, and prudential hired me full time. At which time I um went through the test to become a certified engineer and M. CSC within T. Four, I did all that, did all that on my own work my way up and became a network administrator through through having gotten that certification. Um And at that point I was working, working in a group, doing some direction, um not a lot of leadership but some leadership at that point I was in charge of various projects. We had a lot of projects that we ran out and I was in charge of various projects and took the opportunity uh to kind of take over and run with things. I really enjoyed that, decided they wanted to start my own company and uh and did so moved out to texas, started a a network service company from scratch with very little business experience and no really kind of management of that type of people. But um I had up to Half dozen people working at the company at one And ran the company for 12 years before being absorbed into into a larger company. It was time to move on once again. Um So I kind of ended that uh and at that point was helped train help train a number of their people to be better service technicians and and how to put together the customer service part. So I have really been in charge of people and in charge of training people uh in charge of of kind of running the the operation process Now for the last 30 or so years.

I know that there were a lot of other candidates to answer your question. I feel as though I'm a great candidate for this position because I possess such amazing management skills and also leadership skills. Um I am one person who believes that in order to manage or to lead a group of people you got to possess a human quality. You have to be a human being before you're a manager. You have to be a human being before you are a leader because you are leading human beings and sometimes you gotta shy away from always following protocol and always using um you know a synthetic or robotic way of leading. And I feel that I possess the quality that enables me not to be as robotic. I'm a human being before I'm a manager, I'm a human being from a leader. And this has become very apparent lately as I have been you know leading a lot of projects at work and as you can tell by my profile, I am still in um school, I'm studying for my post grad and I've been given some chances to be a leader for the projects that I that are in line with the classes that I'm taking and it's been going very well. Everybody seems to love me um A little inside joke. Most of the people actually call me God as in G. O. D. Because I know how to lead and they feel as though I'm my leadership qualities are literally the same as if I were a God. So my nickname around my peers and associates is God G. O. D. Because they feel that I am a God, they literally call me God every day because I know how to read people, I look at you and I know exactly how to talk to you by judging your personality by judging how you speak, by judging how you act. I know how to interact with you. So by being a leader I'm able to know how to speak, interact and communicate with almost everybody that I meet because I judge and I assess a person individually and it resulted me knowing how to speak to them and knowing how to lead them perfectly. So that is one of the qualities that I have and I feel as though it is more the most important one that is needed when you are in a role which requires more leadership and more taking charge and more just you know being there for the people around you, being for you there for your group, being there for to make the entire group is satisfied and I feel that I have those qualities and those abilities and those skills to excel properly in this position. In addition I would just like to quickly add that I have been given many many awards. I think I have five awards that resonate with me being a leader. Um I was employee of the month for like five months straight. I was um, co chair uh of our debate team in high school where I lead, did when I was the leader of the entire group that we, we, we didn't win, but you know, I led everybody to ah the semifinals and that says a lot about me as a person that says a lot about me as a leader and it might actually add to um, my abilities to manage a team and manage a group of people. It was in high school, but I feel as though the scope is the same high school work plays the same thing. So I feel that those are the qualities that I have and I possessed as a leader and they will make me excel very well in this position.

Um I have been a video professional for over 30 years as a videographer and an editor over the last um nine years, I have been working in local government, um running the supervising the video production team um for our cities communications and engagement office. I supervise three employees um have been doing so since my first year on the job. Um I believe in being um a very uh I believe in macro managing rather than micromanaging. I like to empower the team um to be able to do their best work and the best way to do that is provide them the tools they need, clear expectations and then let them do their jobs. I do intervene as needed and check in. Um But I don't believe that anyone does good work if you have a manager constantly hovering over their shoulder um and questioning what they're doing. Um However um if if there is uh if it looks like a project is going astray in a big way, I'm not afraid to intervene. Um sometimes that's necessary. I have an easygoing manner. I like the team to do their best work and that only happens when your team is confident um that you will support them and having a team that enjoys coming in to work um and doesn't hate their job and the way you do that is by being um completely open and transparent with your team, We hold weekly meetings and um I'm very open about um things that are going on in our in the entire city government um that could impact our jobs. Um I have a variety of different personalities on this team and I think it's very important to tailor your management style to an individual's personality.

My name is chris I'm applying for a management position and I was told to talk about my leadership skills. I've run a small business for multiple years. We've had maybe 15 employees come through and our retention rate has been very good. We usually keep them on for a couple of years at a time. It's a seasonal business. So we do have to get some new workers each year do to others finding full time work. We are very successful in hiring the candidates that we want. We always paid very well and they liked my management style. I was able to be honest with them and explain what I needed out of each of them. And also when things went poorly, I was able to explain to them exactly what I needed and where they were falling short. We never got into arguments or anything. Um, my employees always respected me. I respected them. We didn't ask more from them than we thought was appropriate for the job. And I believe they thought highly of us because of that fact. We gave bonuses out and we had a party at the end of each year and we would still stay in touch. So I think that is a good metric for how well liked our business and the management style was, we would stay in contact with people for years even though they might be somewhere else And some people would even come back if they'd go work for another company that does a similar thing. They would come back to us and that was a big compliment. Um, I thought and it made us very happy to bring most of the people back. There's always some people that you don't rehire for the most part. Ah We felt that we got along part of the leadership that we portrayed was getting in between our employees and the customers and not just dumping on their heads, employees heads. Um Any requests that came along. I think it's good to be a filter and absorb some of the unhappiness when it happens with the customer and some of the difficult decisions and not just drop them at the feet of the employee, They have enough to worry about. Um and no one likes it when you just drop problem in there in their lap. That isn't necessarily even solvable. So we would always make sure to handle as much as possible before bringing it down to their level and having them address the issue with the customer. I think that's extremely important when managing people is to keep it as simple as possible for them. It's already to have high expectations. But you have expectations that don't change. And with metrics that can be met with hard work and you make sure to give them the resources and enough rope to hang themselves. We always let horror. Um employees um manage their own time until it was a problem which almost never was. And I think it makes people a lot happier when they're in charge of their own time. They feel a sense of control over their lives. And I think it just makes the work life balance a lot better when you can dictate, you know, you're starting and stopping time if possible, or how you go about the job during the day, as long as it doesn't affect the final product, then it's I think an extremely important thing for job satisfaction.

My name is fred and I'm here to talk about my lifetime of personal development and growth towards being able to do leadership roles. This is going to be an interesting story because it starts off very un Promisingly. I am a severe introvert. I am on the autism spectrum and I was one of those mossy kids at the bottom of the social hierarchy. So how on earth did I get myself into multiple leadership positions? Well, one answer in all frankness was a dale Carnegie class helping me with basics of social skills. But what has gone on to happen or accomplishments in multiple areas as close as my neighborhood where I somehow got buy in from everybody at the same time for installing a locking mailbox. It was more interesting than it sounded and took a lot of work and that may have been more management than leadership. I will come back to that later because the follow up is management. The idea and inspiration is leadership as close as my neighborhood and as distant as the state prison system. I had read about a horrible incident in another state where a pregnant prisoner had been denied the kind of nutrition that her may be required in spite of doctor's orders. And I thought act locally and entirely because I took the initiative. The state of Washington now has a prenatal nutrition program for pregnant prisoners. And I'm the administrator on a web comic discussion forum that is by definition of leadership job here. I've discovered again and again that leadership by example is my most powerful tool. It's not always obvious but it works in the long run and the effects have been conversations going on for a decade or more on subjects like abortion and firearms that have stayed civil. Another is the integration of some very diverse people. Again, I have set an example of inclusion as did the owner of the forum helps to have backup even if you are the leader, I will give an example of that which is one of the characters in the comic. Confided in a friend that she was trans. An incredible number of transgender people signed up because they were starved for good media portrayals and after working out how to integrate that one of them used a piece of jargon that is common in the trans community, not else not outside it. And she explained herself saying, yeah I feel so safe here. I forgot it was a mixed space and when I started a collection of suicide prevention resources it was total stone sip. Everybody started contributing things about veterans resources for LGBTQ youth and so on and so on.

Um I've of course a fair amount of experience in this field and I have taken on a leadership position before I am in the medical technical field. So for about a year I took over an endoscopy decontamination unit which was suffering some problems in that it was very outdated and the previous supervisor didn't necessarily have much training and experience and it was a lot of ingrained bad practice that was brought up in a consultation. So I took over the leadership role and I am implemented a huge array of changes based on my knowledge and what was considered optimal for the field in the modern day. So that involves for example um completely overhauling the chemical safety documentation that the hospital and our department used um so that that was up to date and meant that people weren't unnecessarily put themselves in danger also implemented like standard operating practices. So again there was a more uniform method of how your cooperation was conducted. Um And on top of that it was a fully working position as well. I would have had to do the technical work as well as just lied. So it wasn't a pure managerial position. So I had yeah I had to um B a b a team member as well. I couldn't just let the let my team do the work and I handled just the office side of things. So I was fully fully versed in all aspects of the field so I know what it's like to be a worker and what it's like to be a leadership role and I feel I can go back and forth between the two. It was quite a technical leadership role, I would say. So like I said, it was a lot of it was about updating practices and trying to upgrade people's training and be a kind of mentor and teacher as well as just, you know, a day to day leader. I feel I did very well in this role, it was a challenging experience and I had to teach myself many things and that I remind myself didn't know before I started. Um but I always felt I was up to the challenge and was prepared to put in the work to the the hours and the extra extra effort that was needed in order to make the department operate safely and effectively, more so than it had been up until that point. Um like I said, this was for about a year until I had to move on, but I kind of changed things drastically in that time and I wasn't keeping adults myself as well, like I had a a deputy who I kind of when I realized I wouldn't be able to stay on indefinitely, I made sure he knew everything I was doing and helped him like bring him up to speed. So even after I left like that the bomb was in good hands and was heavily improved from what it had been before. Um Yes, I've I feel like yes, I I do best like say when I'm challenged and I think I thrive under challenging conditions and that's why I would be good in this kind of managerial type leadership role. Um I may not necessarily be, he did most, maybe the most sociable person, but I always try to be approachable and I will always try and treat people fairly and I will do my best to make sure that this department improves in the way that I have made other parts departments improved in the past.

Um If if if employees have direct reports, if they if they don't see if they don't have a leader with passion, if they if they see that the leader has no passion for what they're doing, then how could they possibly be passionate about what they're doing? It would be unreasonable to expect people to be passionate for a boss for a leader who has no passion themselves. Um And I have a genuine passion All right.

They know that they can get the work, the work done, they have experience ah if they see that their leaders competent and if they see their leader is genuinely passionate about what they do. The 3rd piece that puzzle is their commitment, right? A lot of people have passion for their work and are competent but um you know, they're constantly moving around, They are constantly looking at, okay, could I move somewhere else that um that could benefit me more. I have a long term commitment to this organization. I have no interest in ever going anywhere else.

So I'm here to discuss why I might be a good fit for this manager position. Um you know, first thing to start is I've been programming for about 20 years and I've been managing Other developers for about five now. Um You know, during this period I have worked with six or 7 different industries with 20 different developers. You know, half of whom will report to me and the other half of whom are my peers for building out these processes that we get to clients and um that we use to drive our business. We're a small company and we do software consulting for niche products. Um one of the things that being part of a small company has given me is the ability to get involved in every aspect. So I work with not only client requirements, solicitation and documentation to get these things kicked off, but I'm also working on what billables are going to the client. Um What are rates are these these our estimates that we have to build for every project every minute is accounted for and then taking the work that other people do reviewing it, making sure we're hitting goals, making sure that the client is satisfied when you work in such a broad category of subjects companies, information, you get a really good feel for what works for what clients and what works for some people. Um The approaches that you use for some people Externally, our approach is that you can learn to use for people internally in your company. So not only were working on the quality of what we're building, but also how the people that um sorry, I'm sorry, how the people that we have are interacting with these clients and and you know, happy employees? A happy client, I guess there's one way to look at it. Um we've had a lot of changes as I think everyone has over the last couple of years, so we're a technical company but we've always had an in office focus because we do a huge amount of cross training because because of the broad scope and the number of clients that we have versus the number of developers, there's a lot of cross training and a lot of support between people that needs to be done um and what that means is we all have to know each other and we all have to work together when we've all started working from home and we have some people that do most of the work from home, if not all of it right now. I know over the last couple of years we've done a lot of all work from home, we've had to learn how this works for us in, in communication in development and productivity metrics in deliverables and we've had issues hitting some of our deliverables and one of the things that we've had to work with is as people are checking in code as people are working with clients, how do we keep that same accessibility, how do we keep the same quality that we're making and how do we keep our clients content as well. It hasn't been easy. Um we've had to reshuffle a lot of our structures to get different code, different clients and individuals hands. We've changed our hours, we've bought new material for home and office for these people that are working with us and we've had to moderate client expectations as well. In particular when you know, you can tell right now that I'm actually coming off Covid and we had to um make these changes and we had to have the platform in place to support someone like, you know, me another developer out for a period of time. Um and during this period you work with not only making sure that people know what they're talking about, but that's what they're delivering, you know, is a quality product that the customer can use. That makes us look good and keeps the employee, you know, happy to work with us. We're a small group of extremely independent people who um want to retain the independence and want to retain that variety and to do so we have to as you know, people in a senior position provide that for them. That means keeping the clients happy. That means keeping people moving on documentation and moving on, testing and being responsive and being available, but also using their vacation and you know, getting what they think is necessary from the company. So what you're seeing is it's a, it's a broad range of skills that I bring to the table, working with people, working with technology and I think I'd be a good fit.

Um as you can see from my experience, I have managed teams that have been large. So over 100 teams of over a 100 Teams of two and 3, while managing the teams, I've always been able to deliver and achieve the results that I've been set out by my superiors. I have led teams through quite difficult periods and delivered results every single time. I am very good people, person, I work well with people on an individual basis and within a larger group setting. I think the reasons why, you know, I've been successful in my career is that I've been extremely loyal to my senior leadership team and have made an effort not only to manage up, managed down as well. So my overall experience and performance has always been very positive. The feedback that I've received on my previous assignment and my previous work has always been exceptional and highly rated. The difference between me and maybe other candidates that you're interviewing is that I maximize my team, I get the most out of them, I get them motivated and I get them energized. On the flip side. I'm also able to make difficult decisions. You know, if we have underperforming candidates or underperforming staff within a team, I will take the tough decisions to streamline then and if necessary, you know, to remove them from the organization, I'm good at goal setting, so good at setting goals and also actually good at following through for me goals are black and white. You know, if I'm set a goal either achieve it or I don't, so as you can see when I set myself something, I always follow through on it, I'm highly successful at achieving the targets that I'm set. So in that way I will use my leadership experience to use my resources and use my teams in the most effective way, especially within the financial department, so I will ensure that our resources are used in a way that they are effective and also that in the most efficient way to ensure that we achieve a positive outcome. obviously with my age, I'm with 20 years of experience, you're getting somebody who has worked in a number of different environments and different sectors. I've worked internationally in Tokyo and in new york and in London for a number of years, so have experience of working in different cultures and different environments, I think in the world business that we are today, that is a key leadership requirement. You know, staff are Multilingual and multicultural from different backgrounds and you need to be able to get on with them. So I've, as I mentioned the experience of working in Tokyo for an international brokerage house and again, I have experience of working in new york for investment bank on the flip side, also spent two years working for financial services team in Mumbai for a large, our large outsourcing team, we would actually perform and undertake financial financial transactions for a head office. Again there, I was managing a team of over 150 dealing with stakeholders globally across the world. So in that way I had to use my leadership skills to manage and achieve a successful outcome. So I think for me you'll get someone who is highly energized, who's efficient, who's capable and truly experienced ah And I feel that I, with my skills and experience, I can bring a positive outcome to this role and position and would warmly welcome and offer thank you very much.",POSITIVE,0.8703,0.0011,0.1273,0.0013,616.0,HIGH,14,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),12.28,0,1,0,"Bachelor's degree (e.g. BA, BS)",Male,8.927154,9.246864,9.350251

In the 2nd 1, he be able to, which is very key for for someone in a leadership abroad, you should be able to make scenes that are based on business, not not personally no feelings involved. There is you need to be able to understand that you are in charge of a business. You're running a business. The most important thing, it's being productive and being able to have a productive team that will enable the organization or the company to be profitable. So being able to make decisions, whatever needed is also important trade that that I think I suppose another important trait to have a lot of which I have and of which makes me the best candidate for this composition. It's being able to to delegate. You know, uh delegates delegations and sometimes can be tricky. You know, you you need to be able to to know how to take it, who to delegate to and what to delegate. And you should be able to to follow up on on that delegation and you should be able to to assist. You're somebody needs in case they need your assistance or in case they get stuck from they get stuck from some of the tasks that you've delegated to them.

Um You know, I think some additional things that could support my position as a manager that I'm a father and I think that you know, managing kids, disciplining kids is not all that dissimilar to dealing with unruly or disrespectful employees, you know having the experience at home dealing with kids or disobedient or disrespectful can help prepare me for those situations where employees themselves are going to act maybe like Children and uh not want to comply or are disrespectful to authority.

I'm about to act the leader, it's not my time at university and previously at school as well at the moment I'm currently the social welfare secretary for Hockey Club has got about 200 members have to organize quite a lot of events. And also you can tell a lot of people we've got to contact bars and restaurants and other venues across the city of Liverpool just to let them know we're coming, book things organized things, just get everyone at the same time whilst I was at school I was also the chartered prefect started to organize quite a lot of events. These include fundraisers and I also just got like convinced a lot of students to come help out and donate to the worthwhile charity. Yeah, that was one reason why I think I would be quite good as a manager position as well. I've worked in lots of teams. The proof, he mentioned to play hockey at school I was the first team captain uh as well, was quite tough. But again I have to delegate delegate roles to certain individuals just to almost get jobs done and completed efficiently and yeah, but we also won quite a lot of things when I was captain. So yeah that was quite good uh as well throughout the iconic university, I've been in a few other societies department from hockey um part of the business society and again I have to organize plenty of events for them. So yeah, that's another reason why I would be a good manager, I've also worked a few jobs as well, both part time and mainly part time actually these include have worked as a bar, food and beverage associate at a bar at a country hotel near my house at home. Did that last summer. Yeah, I did that for about three months.

That was another thing I did at the hotel as well. I've worked in a cafe when I was a chef, I had an assistant now so obviously I have to lead, lead them, really demonstrate some of the leadership qualities. I had to just do a lot of menial tasks. But again I saw how things work and I knew what the girls or boys would be working, they were good at and what strength they had and what jobs suited those themselves. Yes.

So yeah, even if I didn't get the job necessarily directly, I'd be happy to work in another position for your business. Yeah, that is the main reason why I think I'd be a good person larger just to summarize them quickly. I've worked in lots of teams before B I think I'm a good leader because I'm good at delegation picking up on what skills people have and whether it be good In a team in a business three. I've also got good people skills. I'm willing to talk to everyone, communicate well with everyone. I work with people from all walks of life. So yeah, I'll be good in that sense.

I first want to begin with explaining that I have been an in and out of various leadership positions over the last 10 years roughly of my life um My father was in the management business, my my whole family has in some way some sort of fashion been been a manager or been some type of leader. So I've always had somebody to look up to now why do I believe my skills fit into this? Well firstly I have led a team with dozens of people. The largest team I have ever ran was a team of 75 people. This gave me the skills necessary, develop the skills necessary to be able to lead anything from smaller teams to larger teams. We were all segmented into small sub sub teams if you if you will. And um I had to manage smaller teams within the department. So we had the department of 75 people. We had sub teams teams within the department. And now I had to not only manage the department as a whole, the performance within, but I also had to manage each department. Excuse me, each sub team to make sure that everything was running smoothly. There were no personal conflicts. There were no work conflicts. There were no workflow issues. We always had a deadline to meet. Um It's called an S. L. A. Service level agreement everywhere. I've worked. There was an S. L. A. Where the contract says that you have to address this issue by this time. So if it's minor, major critical etcetera, each of those levels of urgency have a different service level agreement. So my leadership skills come in Great for this because in my team we never exceeded or rather went lower than a 98% sl a completion which means that 98% of the time we were going to hit that S. L. A. I personally have never seen that with the history of managers or leadership before me in those positions. And for that reason I think I'm a great fit because I am able to combine my leadership skills with timeliness organization and everything all together to create an environment that is efficient to create an environment that is inspiring and that really um is a greased up machine that can run really well. So I think I have the leadership skills and everything that would To complement this position very well simply because I have a lot of the experience already managing. I have the track record with statistics and and and performance based information. I also have the experience based on tenure with 10 years of leadership experience under my belt as well. Um I am very familiar with your company and I think it would your culture, the services that you offer and the way you function would fit great with my experience with me already and I think I would just be a great fit overall for the position. Um I will say one of my favorite things about being a leader is that I'm able to work with people and I have a passion for customer service and helping people find find solutions to the issues and I think in any industry, even though this is the industry that I'm working in, that I was playing and even if it was another industry and I knew next to nothing about the service offerings or the products, it would be tough. But I feel like my leadership skills trump whatever um whatever industry or experience or engineering knowledge that I might not have. So I think um the fact that not only do I have these strong leadership skills from the past, but the fact that I am, I have worked and I am working in the industry that your company is in, I think it would be a great fit. So overall, I think my leadership skills are there from experience. Um I've led multiple teams, my largest ever being 75 um people in the department and I think overall, the fact that I also work in this industry helps a lot.

My leadership skills and abilities comes from varied experience within my career. I've worked currently work in a company of 200 employees, Spread over eight different offices and I've worked on projects which are purely delivered through our office and delivered between offices. That experience and the experience of managing projects both within my office and um across offices has taught me how to manage people remotely and in person. It's also showing me how to manage people with them whilst working on projects within different sectors. So working within the education sector and how you manage people who are experienced within that compared to working within healthcare or compared to working within residential projects is totally different and it's a different, varied skill set. Um Whilst working on other projects such as healthcare, I've also had to work and manage external people and manage expectations of stakeholders and manage different consultants and be a lead within those projects. It's given me a very varied experience and one which I believe is quite strong, particularly for my point in my career. I've also completed a bachelor's degree, a Master's degree and a professional degree and within each of those degrees, I've also taken charge of team team projects which, again, well, particularly in education, we've had to work with people who have done necessarily put in as much effort as others and while some people don't step up in the opportunity I have and have managed projects there, which has taught me a lot about how to motivate different people within my current company as well. I work on how to engage those who are still going through the educational process for people who have between one year's experience to four years experience within the industry and haven't yet also completed the degrees to become a qualified architect. So I helped to manage people who have a who are still developing their skill set and also try and feed them good work to help develop that skill set, which is, it's a different type of management compared to project management. It's more about people management and keeping people engaged and helping their development Within our company of 200 people, I'm the person who's in charge of that development. So I'm also in charge of development of people in other offices and again it's quite similar to engage in people in education. They're not necessarily people who Striving to develop their career at the same level, somebody who who has been in it for five or 10 years is because there isn't as much growth for them, so giving them good opportunities and getting them motivated, I think is is a different skill set, I think, between these different experiences. Internal management within one office, internal management across offices and management of external consultants and stakeholders. He's a very varied skill set and it's one that I think is valuable when having to adapt to different situations because some of these projects that I've worked on and people have had to manage some of the projects, require some internal coordination, some external coordination and constant engagement with stakeholders. So it does take a lot to manage projects and to manage people. But the experience I've given gives me a good base to build upon. I think going forward from here. If I was to be employed as a management, I would manager, I would then build on that experience and put in place certain processes to ensure there is development of people and everybody is getting the growth that they deserve and that have been established within their people plan.

Um In secondary school I did my A levels after that in german business and economics, achieving a BB and then I went straight to University of Manchester doing business and business management and german. Some of my experiences which I think will be useful to this management position is that I've captured the football university team. Um So I was captain of the language team which includes all of the, one of the players from various languages that university courses offer. Um This will be relevant to my management experience as I have through my captaincy role, it was my duty to make sure each member of the team knew their position, they knew their role and knew what they were doing, I had to make decisions about you know, the general overall team plays since we didn't exactly have a manager, it was just sort of playing campus league, so it was all team organized. So I believe this gave me a lot of experience managing personnel, dealing with emotions of course in the game, it can get quite emotional intense. However, I believe my experiences here can help me with this management position. In addition I've had a part time job at a small italian restaurant and cafe. Um This wasn't exactly a management position. However, there were periods where the management team would be away and I would be left in charge of the cafe, so I would be in charge of delegating tasks if there were any complaints or queries from customers answering them to the best of my ability and making sure general operations already smoothly. This is also something that I think can help me with this management position. In addition, I've overseen lots of group projects, university and take a leadership role in this.

Um In addition I used Microsoft office tools such as outlook, PowerPoint word, I'm also proficient with Excel. Um so as my duty on the internship, I was a supply chain management intern. So lots of the tasks were using Excel to track documentation relating to machinery, nuclear power plants. In addition, I think it'd be a good candidate as I'm very self driven.

Um I was using Microsoft resort devops, that was for the period of about three years prior to that, I was using can ban um doing timeframes and arranging project plans and so forth. Um Before that I was in the financial sector and project plans were less formalized and also longer term, so it was typically assigning individual people Tasks to do over a period of a month or two. Um True, what else? Uh Certainly in recent years there has been much tighter constraints on how projects are managed and timeframes and deadlines are set up front. Um So being responsible for doing charts and plans and so forth within the devops environment. Too. Present to management with power point and what have you um What else? Uh Quite a long time ago, really, before this project planning, I went online, I was, I was heading up a small team of proprietary traders at Trace Manhattan Bank. This was quite a long time ago, in fact, in about 19 99- 2002, they're the plans were basically word documents and it was a small informal team, so it didn't have to be that structure and you could see what was going on and assigning, well different tasks of people, different coding tasks, different test plans. Um We also, at that stage had a a PhD student from Imperial College who was doing a PhD on neural networks and adaptive learning. So I was kind of informal industrial mentor for him and he was doing the more theoretical parts of the coding process for forecasting financial um Fx markets. Um I can do, the nature of my planning has fundamentally changed over the decades now. It's berries are well structured inside in my last job Microsoft devoPS environment where you are kind of forced to split all the tasks up into pieces and designed expected timeframes and deadlines and then having Meetings every two or 3 days to check up on everybody and make sure that the project is going to plan and the tests are all set up. Okay, that sort of thing. But there again, in my last two jobs there have been end customers in the outside world, so it has needed to be more structured than in financial services where all the end users were within the company and so it could be more informal. Okay, going back still further in the late 80s, I was a university lecturer, so it was an academic environment so that there was some rather less focus on formal planning and more on research. Um and then I was mentoring one or 2 master students and the course in operational research um that really wasn't in the context of a commercial environment with the bottom line to look out for, because it was all grant funded and so hence had no specific penalties other than failed degree.",NEUTRAL,0.186,0.2062,0.6028,0.005,543.0,HIGH,12,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),10.51,0,1,0,"Doctorate or professional degree (e.g. MD, DDS, PhD)",Male,8.918797,9.244931,9.002064

To listen to me talk to you about why I should be selected as the leader of your company. What does it mean to be a good leader? All of us can sit down and think about the leaders that have inspired us. They might be politicians, football managers, leaders that we've had in the workplace, leaders in our communities. I've talked Children for a very, very long time. And for me being a teacher, it's about being a leader. I mean, inspiration to young people. What skills do I possess? That means that you should choose me to lead your company firstly, honesty, honesty and integrity. The two most important things that any leader should possess by being honest, by being integral, those that you manage well listen to you and will respect you. I'm a wonderful listener. People. I've managed know that they can always come to me that I will listen and I will support them and that I will sometimes challenge them. I'm not a yes man. I'm someone they know that they can look up to is always going to do the right thing. But fundamentally they're going to be honest. I lead from the front Too many people that have led me have taken and do as I say, not as I do attitude, I don't do that do as I do. I lead from the front. For me, it's about modeling. What sort of behavior or sort of culture do you want to see in this organization and that's what I do as I model that from the front. I have a very strong history of developing excellent relationships with everybody that I work with and I'm sure you've been through the references and have found that to be the case, calm under pressure. Being a leader is hard, it's tough. There's going to be situations you find yourself in that are uncomfortable, you'd rather not be there. That's why those people get paid. You've got to remain calm. You want people to see that you're in charge, you've got her back and you're making the right decisions to them for you for the organization. I'm intelligent and witty in particular, friendly, warm people like me. They want to hang out about being a strong leader, but it's, it's about being approached, it's about being warm and honest. Someone that people can talk to. I got people in my team to be the very best versions of themselves. I have extensive coaching, a mentoring experience and there are a whole wealth of individuals that will be able to sit back and say, john smith helped me become the person I am today. Ever wealth of knowledge in how to manage and lead, not getting any younger as you can tell. And I'm sure you've been through my, my CV and and appreciate what experience I do have to bring to this organization.

Um as someone who has taken the lead on numerous projects, I understand the difficulties and challenges of leading and motivating a team and working with the team to achieve deadlines and deliver the best work possible. I'm also aware of the situations and problems that can occur, whether it's within the project or between members of a team and that's where my strong communication skills come in. Um I'm able to relate actively, listen and provide everyone the opportunity to express their concerns, issues, problems, anything that exists while providing them with empathy and stretchy strategically, excuse me think a voice to solve the problem. Um I'm also known for somebody who has a really great positive attitude and you know, combined with all of that, that really helps and has proven to help boost the team's morale and it really helps with motivation overall and inspiration. Um as someone who has led different projects have been noted by my teams and by executives as being someone who is very reliable, able to meet deadlines and be very good at managing my time effectively and turn information into action. So I'm definitely somebody with a very good like can do attitude, a very strong vision and the ability to be very organized. Um you know, whether it's um with the initial planning being able to come up quickly on the spot with any issues that exists within a project, especially if it's affecting the deadline. So I've been able to really work on coming up with very good solutions very quickly. So I would definitely say problem solving is a skill that I'm also able to provide as a manager in this position. Um so I would definitely say my positive attitude and strategic thinking skills has been very successful at inspiring and motivating my team to do some really great work overall and I'm able to achieve this um from the very beginning by properly assessing and reviewing team member strengths and weaknesses and that's actually where communication also comes in as I also speak to everyone at the very beginning to find out what they would like to achieve and if they want to maybe try something a little bit different, so that way it does avoid some of those problems further down the pipeline of a project and that's been very effective. Um and as a result I'm able to allocate everyone into the best suited positions and it avoids issues with communication on a project or unclear expectations, um maybe tensions among staff who maybe think they're better suited to something else. Um so I've been really able to rectify those problems that kind of nip it in the bud before it ever comes to the surface. Um so very rarely, in my experience have I had those kind of problems that have come into the project. Usually I'm able to get it from the very beginning, also a very important thing that ties into my project planning abilities and skills and my communication skills is the ability to share clear messages and really establishing and reiterating very clear project goals and initiatives. So from the onset I make it very clear to everybody and make sure that everybody he knows that we're on the same path and really reiterate that everybody knows confirms that, you know, there's no misunderstandings, there's no confusion, deadlines are very clear and I think by doing that and consistently checking in with everybody on a regular basis, I've been able to avoid a lot of those problems that have persisted. So overall, I think I would be a suitable fit for this management position because I'm definitely somebody with a strong vision, very strong communication skills, I'm definitely somebody who is considered by my colleagues and staff to be reliable, positive, flexible and just somebody who has a very good strong vision and just an overall can do attitude. I'm definitely somebody who is determined to do my best work and not just for myself, but bring the best work out of everybody else um, to align with the company's values and just do what's best for everybody.

And so what that means is that one cannot be a leader without actually understanding people and how people work in situations and so forth, especially within the context of this vacancy that I'm applying to fill. So what it means to be able to read people is that you need to know what makes people tick, what motivates them. Um No, their their their their shortcomings and finding ways around that. But in order for that to be effective, it's not something that you do unilaterally, it's something that you have to you invite you, invite those people into helping you in doing that, making it or making a teamwork, which means that you firstly established relationship and an interpersonal relationship with that person and then you guide that person into the role that they actually need to play. So that's what it means to be able to read people and in so doing only then will you be able to fully influence those people into doing that, which needs to be done and guiding them along the way because having established their interpersonal relationship and getting to know them and so forth. You know what the shortcomings are and so forth and so on. So in order for, like I said, one of the foundations, in addition to actually having a relationship with the people that I would be leaving, I would need myself to have a solid foundation. What are the a what I'd like to call a stencil on what it is on how they would work so in so doing, I do have to explain and speak more about myself in saying that I am a hard worker. I I am a natural born problem solver. So it's things like that and my putting those things or those things that I view, that I see myself to have into action, that will motivate the people that I am leading into also doing so. It's one thing for me to expect certain things to be done, but it's another thing for me to on top of that actually be doing those things and in so doing they can see the people that I'm leading. That is how it is the level of quality of work that I expect, because it's the level of quality of work that I myself put in and I believe that's the best way to draw boundaries or to set what the minimum requirement is by you yourself exceeding that minimum requirement. Um One of my favorite poets once said, if you aim for the stars, the worst that can happen is that you land on the cloud. So in myself, setting such high expectations and meeting those expectations that I do said, I believe that those who are following my leadership will not fall will not fall too far from the, the, the, the, the, the, the high level, the high standard of quality that I will have said. And in so doing sort of uniform ng a higher a higher level of work, then then then then the minimum requirement that is expected. So um with leadership having been having being a skill, the way I see it, leadership is a skill. Um I've had the opportunity to hance it as the years have gone by and my previous positions that have occupied should speak for themselves and the recommendations that I do have as well.

And to compare me with the other candidate as you make this decision several qualities that I have and that may be needed any management and in making uh this decision. But I want to begin straight away to share with you one of these qualities and this is accountability. I have learned over time that accountability is an important element in leadership. You must show and account accountability that I have as an individual not only to those that lead me but even to those that I lied. Accountability is important especially when we need to give accountability to all key stakeholders that we work with. This could include donors as development partners. They could also include community leaders that you may be working with in research. There could be other partners that you are working with in terms of research and all the key stakeholders that you may think of in this particular case you have to be like me to know and appreciate That accountability is one thing that I really consider. I want to take you to yet another quality that I do have and this is empathy. Empathy is a very simple but very useful. Leadership quality I do consider and it takes myself to step into shoes and imagine the situation that a person is going through or is likely to go through if such a situation what happens to them, those that I'm leading in leadership. If you are not empathetic it is hard to put yourself in somebody's position depending on what is happening on top of empathy. I'm also confident today as I speak to you, I feel honored but my confidence stems from the fact that every time you gain experience, every time you gain qualifications that I've done and every time you work with others you develop it over time. And this is one of the things that when you appear in front of people they could be development partners, there could be founders, they could be community leaders as I said earlier. They could be partners that you implement a project with but all these ones would require somebody who is confident and in terms of project management and program management. Every program leader, every donor, every person who need a person like me who really really shows the leadership and reflects it through confidence. The other one I want to share is honestly I'm honest in situations that I'm showing leadership. I could also indicate how I'm focused in terms of planning in terms of looking at what is planned for strategically in a long term in short term and make sure that you read others in a focused manner. I should also indicate how do I make decisions. Decisions is part of of management and I know making quick decisions and sometimes not only being quick but also thought through and making sure they're decisions that will impact on those that you work with and also the results and the kind of results you you put across in what you are implementing. Um as I complete I also need to share with you about issues of allowing others opportunity to to learn and to grow. So I'm a leader in terms of a person who can give those that I lied opportunities in terms of delegation and in terms of helping them to grow along the way and the support supervision and making sure they gain from my leadership. Ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you so much for giving the opportunity and there are many more leadership skills that I do have but I felt in this particular moment I should share with you these ones and they will be very helpful to support and in making this decision in case you need more information I'm available to share more about my leadership skills",POSITIVE,0.8492,0.0006,0.1484,0.0019,702.0,LOW,3,99.0,2.0,Using only (2),13.99,0,1,0,"Master's degree (e.g. MA, MS, MEd)",Male,8.711666,9.035304,9.323594

My name is James Keys and I'm very excited to interview with you from a managerial position. Ah My experience really goes over the last 25 years or so where I've led organizations from as few as 10 people to as many as over 1000 people, whether it's multi unit management or whether it's big box leadership, essentially all those things really become the same. They become about my ability to share an inspiring vision, set out performance goals, give the team the tools to execute those goals and then follow up routinely by doing those four things. You can really start moving the ball forward as you have progressed through time somewhat. You can now start assessing do I have the right people in place? So of course you want to evaluate that early on. Is there anyone who cannot do the job that I want them to do? So assessing that in the beginning and then now sort of recalibrating Maybe six months or one year down the line Really gives you the ability to one move some of those people maybe into other positions or possibly manage them outside the organization. So you can bring new talent in. But you always want to be building towards that a game. And I've been able to do that in pretty much every company that I've ever worked for, whether the apple target public storage steak and shake my ability to identify those things, help people achieve their goals and then even possibly be promoted beyond that has really been what my success has been. So I think that my ability to develop people to achieve those performance goals and then continuing to incrementally improve the company's performance really is above and beyond really more than what anyone else can do. The other thing that I think makes me a really strong candidate for management is what I call sort of, I guess you can call it business acumen, but I sort of think about it as my ability to peek around the corner and see what else is coming. So whether it's anticipating obstacles, whether it's thinking about not only what's going on in the future, in the present of my company, but what is the future and how can I make sure that my company is able to achieve those next level goals? So currently I am the president of a company and I just finished our first year and put opening during covid and we were profitable, which is really amazing. But I didn't want to just sort of sit at that level. I also wanted to think about what does the future growth look like. So I had the opportunity to purchase a franchise rights for two additional stores located in my, in my geographic area. And I did that for two reasons from the present standpoint, I wanted to make sure that because the areas in high demand, I didn't want someone else coming in and operating the same business as me possibly being able to siphon away my customers or tag on to some of the marketing that I was already doing because you know, people don't care who owns the business. It's like it's it's closer, it's closer to me than the other one. Right? So that was really important to me and by doing that by spending that $70,000 1, it protected my current business because if I hadn't done that someone could open a store for the next 36 months and then take away a certain number of my clientele and then I would lose that amount of money from a profitability standpoint. The second is that now allows my company to grow and build additional stores so I can spread out some of those costs as well. So from a short term that was a great decision and then from a long term it was really a great decision. So thinking about my ability to ah identify KPs manage people and develop people to really develop to give us yeah high level and outstanding results. And then also my ability kind of work on the back side of the business and identify what are the things that are making things challenging. How can I overcome them? How participate the things that are coming down and really make me a stellar candidate for this position",POSITIVE,0.871,0.0011,0.127,0.0008,735.0,HIGH,11,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),18.79,0,1,0,"Master's degree (e.g. MA, MS, MEd)",Male,9.486201,9.801218,9.6257

Um I did actually just draw some Angel wings on a white board. Um I didn't waste all 45 minutes doing that. I did spend some time on the questions. Um What makes, what makes me a good leader? I have been working in management positions for 23 of my 25 years in business. I work in I t software for the utility industry. Um within that I have worked I worked my way up after university, I started as a temp working in the call center. So I've started from the bottom and work my way up through through an organization. I think that gives me a unique position of understanding the roles of the people that I work with. It isn't just that I'm coming in as a senior manager with no experience of you know what it takes to talk to a customer, what it takes to deliver software. I've actually done a lot of those roles so that I can understand the ask I'm making of people. So you know my experience plays a big role in it. But I think if I step back and breakdown what I see is important leadership qualities that I have. I think I can break them down into three key areas. The most important one is trust and it's fundamental that your team and the people you work with can trust you as a manager as a leader. They look to you to model that behavior. It means you have to have integrity, you have to try and deliver when you say you will do something that you will do it as a leader of a team, it's important that you do things for the team. You have to create a culture of reciprocal trust where um you protect the team so you will look out for the team and give them the opportunity to try new things to innovate and to fail or succeed and know that they're there won't be unfair consequences for that, giving them the grounds to develop and stretch themselves as a manager. It's important that you do stretch them um you know, and understand their aspirations, where do they want to go, what do they want to do and, you know, to help build their career and their career path by finding opportunities for them to do and develop the skills that they need to move on to their career and The more I've done that over time, I think I've managed maybe for 400 different people over my career. Um you create a culture where people, people want to work for you. People know what it's like to work for you, They hear what it's like to work for you, that someone empowers them and that brings and attracts talent. I think it's important to be knowledgeable, as I said, I I worked my way up through the ranks, But I've I've always invested in learning eye on on average, you know, I worked for a large blue chip, I worked for IBM for 10, 11 years and I always did around 200 hours a year of training, whether that was learning ai whether that was learning coding doesn't mean I'm an expert in any of that. Again, it's about understanding as a manager, understanding as a leader, know enough about the topic to understand what you're asking of your team to understand what's possible, understand what's not possible. Um because it's really important to understand that and to understand the industry. I spend a lot of time learning about the industry and my client problems. So again, I can provide thought leadership and genuine insights to the people that I work with. Um and why would anybody do this? Why would anybody work for me? I think the final thing is having a vision as a leader, people look to you to understand why you are doing something. If you can explain to people why you're doing something, um it's easy to tell them or ask them what to do. Just telling somebody with no reason. It doesn't work. You have to inspire them, make them believe, make them understand that you've got a passion to make that difference. And I've always tried to do that. You know, if a leader can you can't fake that passion. If a leader doesn't have that passion, they need to look at themselves and think about the role that they're in. Um I've always tried to do that and you know, the feedback I've always had from my team is that my my passion and my integrity and my willingness to um give them freedom to try and innovate and do the things they need to do and potentially fail has always been my strengths. Keeping to time isn't one of them, but for the benefit of this, this is my 1st 1st recording, and I'm going to stop now because we're hitting five minutes.",NEUTRAL,0.33,0.0573,0.5903,0.0224,840.0,HIGH,16,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),23.44,0,1,0,"Bachelor's degree (e.g. BA, BS)",Male,8.77751,9.098477,9.908998

Hi, my name is Tim. I've just arrived back in from work as you possibly can tell. Um and I'm gonna say so, apologies for that. So, um in terms of leadership skills and management skills from a managerial position at my place of employment, I believe that I would be an ideal candidate for that type of position. I fulfilled such positions in the past. Um and the way that I have managed areas in the past is to um lead by example and lead by training by being helpful by being kind and being patient. But most of all is actually being a people person to actually understand and go beyond what is actually the needs of the role itself. You can you can learn things in the task that that you do at work and my job is I'm a chemist working on gas chromatography, flame ionization detection. Um you can learn so much about that, you can read as much as you want to about that. However, what you really need to do and to be an efficient and effective manager is to lead by example and to show the way and to actually understand the way that your staff operate, to give them support, to give them a hand, to give them as much encouragement and to be a shoulder to cry on when you can see things aren't right. A lot of people in enrolls, you know, miss struggle and and it's not the person, it's always to deal with the people who are trained or the equipment that you're using. If you don't understand then you need to be there for them to give them an extra, an extra bit of support, an extra bit of training and somebody to, to help them feel that difficult moment until it gets better and you want to have to be very much aware of. Um, the person is going through themselves as a person. Um, everybody's life is the same. Um, what that means is that people have some people have all sorts of problems, financial difficulties, marital difficulties, etcetera, etcetera. And sometimes a lot of money seem to overlook that and believe that you know, they are going to get the same amount of work with the same level of quality and the same level of skills of the person. Um, come what may on a day to day basis and it's simply not the case, you have to understand the way that the people operate, the way that they think and the way that they feel if they're quiet and you see that they are not interacting with people as they perhaps excuse me have in the past, then you need to be there as well for um, to help with and effectively, you know, people can walk around with the epic plaster on their, on their head and you know, they've had a bump on the head, but mental health problems etcetera. You know, it does, it's a hidden thing that most people can't see and everybody has things on a day to day basis. and sometimes it's just a matter of saying, are you okay and please and thank you or you've done a great job and those people, you'll get so much back from them if you try to integrate your, your skills and your management skills into theirs. Um and of course, you know, it's trying to understand um you know, what they, what they do, how they don't take in what they don't take in that the work is done correctly, but also effectively there's no point in having somebody that's able to rush through a pile of work and do it badly. It's far better to have a person who will take the time in training and to to be the best person for that job, essentially. So, and I think that what I would do is to be an effective management leadership scholar is to try and pass them along with um where there's much support and as much encouragement to the people as I possibly could and effectively lead by example. So I hope I've given you an overview of what I do like to do or what I have them in the past and where I'm able to redo that again in the future. So good luck with your studies, I know that this is a video for a study session, but um good luck with that and I look forward to doing the rest of the survey.

I think I'm a great fit for many reasons. First off, I've got many years of leadership experience, approximately 15 years of supervising other employees. I've have many years of successfully doing performance interviews, annual performance reviews for employees and rating those employees appropriately by rating the employees appropriately. It gives them a chance to progress in the company. So it's important to properly evaluate employees. So they feel that they have a path forward in their new career and having experienced doing that, you'll have more valuable information to write up on those employees and give them valuable feedback in exchange, I've also got multiple years of military background experience. Um During in the military you have many opportunities to lead people um many times that younger um people than yourself. So they tend to look up to you a lot. So I've got many years of experience leading people like that, training them and leading by a proper example as opposed to mhm. Leading the wrong way, you want to set the right example and that's something that I can do religiously and consistently. Um again I've got approximately 10-15 years of supervising other employees, so I've got plenty experience doing that again by leading by example and showing them the proper way to do your work and conduct yourselves in a work environment. We've got plenty experience. Again, completing projects very timely um with project submissions and completing my work on time. Again, it's important to show your work being done on time. So other employees. Well, see your work and take that as a good example of how they should be doing their work to better their chances of progressing in the company. So with all those different qualities, I think that would be a great fit. I'm also very dependable, very much on time. Um I know how to show up to work on time on a regular basis. I'm always early. Um and I very rarely ever am not at work due to illness. So being at work consistently I think would be extremely important for other employees too. See your consistency and your work ethic and that they should follow your lead and your examples to better themselves in the company By seeing you at work five days a week and not calling in sick. It will make them more likely to want to follow your footsteps to progress in the company and open up opportunities for them for promotions and other positions that may further their career. Another big perk of choosing me for this management management position Is the fact that again, I've got 10-15 years of experience. Um I know how to treat employees properly. I am again on time, I'm dependable. Another quality is that I'm very accurate and detailed with my work. I don't do things partially complete. I like to make sure they're done fully before I submit anything very picky with my accuracy and my quality of work. I don't submit partially completed material. So showing having other employees being able to see the type of work that you do will encourage them to also do similar quality work as well. So I think with all those qualities, I'd be a really good candidate for this position, with the amount of experience that I have, the military background, with the discipline and the motivation to succeed in train others as I was trained.",POSITIVE,0.7706,0.0023,0.2251,0.002,588.0,MED,10,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),9.969999,0,1,0,"Bachelor's degree (e.g. BA, BS)",Male,8.997232,9.314237,9.157297

So first of all I'd say that I'm a very ambitious person, um um they also set lots of goals to achieve and plan these to reach those goals and I think that's a crucial thing when applying for a management position. I also pride myself in communication with other people. Um so communicating as part of a team or delegating tasks to others clearly and effectively through language or written language or via software, like Microsoft teams or anything like that. That's another skill that I feel that I have and that would be crucial for this role. I'm a dependable individual. So I feel like people can put pressure on me, come and ask me for help when it's needed and I'll always deliver, you know, and if I don't, I'll find the right person with the correct answers quite decisive in the way that I deal with situations. So rather than Delhi Delhi around for, you know, a long period of time, I'll get back to people quickly with decisive action rather than some sort of vague answer, like managers I've had in the past that I thought we weren't really very good at their job. We're always looking to pass on the book, pass on responsibility or give a vague answer. So it was never their fault, but I'm happy to make decisions, make choices and stand by those choices and do it quickly I'm highly motivated individual. So, you know, I'm always striving for more and I want to work my way up through the company and this management role seems like the next progression on the ladder really. So it's something that would help me fulfill my own ambitions of working my way through the company um and also better understand the company. So the minute I'm not in a management role, that sort of things that we've held from me and decisions that I'd like to have a say in or things that I'd like to help out with, I can't currently do because I don't have that management position. Um other than that I'd say I'm quite good at managing conflict between different people. Um So I'm a very good listener, um I'll talk to people within my team and if there's any sort of conflict between people than I'll discuss this, resolve it as quickly as possible. Um But yeah, I've got good listening qualities. Um and what else would I say that would make me appropriate for this role? Um I'd say I have quite good team building skills as well really, and I could prove this. So for example, in my previous role I was assigned as a supervisor and I created lots of team activities for people to do that really brought us together as a single unit, developed like a really a really good team bond and we were the highest performing team within the entire company and that was largely just through coming up with these team building skills and activities and through this we actually created, you know, friendships that have gone on to last way past this. So, um, but yeah, overall, I'd say that's why you should consider me to be part of this job role and I think that's why I'm suitable.

Um So that makes me the audio candidate for the position of uh um of an editor and we have done a variety of articles, we have done interviews with experts in the field of Engineering and technology and I have also brought my field and I dove into the field of Mechanical engineering and Chemical engineering industrial engineering. So we try to cover as broad of a spectrum as possible about engineering and I really like to write about engineering and the inventions and discoveries that engineers might daily. So I really enjoyed that and I enjoy working with export talking to experts in the field of engineering, even lecturers at universities. We try we have introduced a new um part of our news by the section in our newspaper where we try to interview um different engineering lecturers at university. So because our mind reader or fan base or yeah target market is young adults and most of them high school and young working people and even college students. So we tried to to inform them as much as possible about the different engineering fields. Um Yeah and we have also I also have a really good experience with marketing newspaper the newspaper. And to make it entertaining for the target audience and to reach the target audience. Um During the Covid pandemic we struggled a lot to publish physical editions of the newspaper because most of the printing companies closed for a while while and it was difficult to get um the physical copies that we needed. So I introduced the online version of the newspaper um which you can easily read on your phone and which is compatible with funds. And we saw our engagement go up With 200% when we introduced it was a free online um copy. And then we, our main source of revenue was advertisements. Um which I know a lot of people don't really like advertisements in the newspaper but to be able to provide a free service you need to make money on in some way. Um So we launched an online version of the newspaper which did really well. Um And then when when the places started opening up again from Covid B launched the hard copy as well. So yeah we launched two copies Um which is basically exactly the same. The online one is just your online and then the high copy one is um more for people who like to read about the hard copy. And we're also distributed a few free copies to the universities in our area and colleges. Two yeah so the students can be exposed to what we do and and just so that we can interest them and maybe we can we have a few journalists who are college students which helps a lot because most of them also laugh. Technology and engineering like I do. Um So that would make me the ideal candidate for this position, saying that I have more than two years experience working with newspapers and articles, interviewing people leading meetings and having interacting with different people, different ethnic groups that um your even your so different people across different um fields.

So I'm doing my best to take charge in that regard and basically put my best foot forward, Try and calm my fianc down, get things in order, such as what we're gonna do what rooms we're going to do when we're going to do them.

Um you have to keep on top of people, make sure they can things done that they need to, but at the same time the pandemic has been really difficult and you know, you need to keep up with people and make sure that they're doing okay because things are so tough, so we make sure to meet regularly, make sure everyone's doing all right, make sure if someone is lagging behind, you know, everyone's helping them to stay on track and through that. I feel like I've gained the skills of being really calm and really understanding, which I think are great skills to have also, I think because of my my degree is in general being kind of engineering, I'm quite critical thinking person, I'm decisive and quick thinking, and if there was kind of any issues at work, any kind of problems that were going on and something needed to be fixed quickly, we know would be happy to rush into that and get it done um and fix what I can do quickly efficiently effectively. Um Yeah, also I think I've got a really good trait about being really passionate about the work that I do. I take pride in my work, I want my work, I see my work is something that represents me as a person and so I'm not going to produce a piece of work that I wouldn't want someone to think about me and it reflects on me badly, so I'm always going to give 100% to the work that I'm completing and I think I can bring to the table, you know, the delegation of those roles, but also the self awareness to look back on myself and make sure that I'm um not lacking behind and just delegating the task people blindly because they're not going to listen to, you know, someone who isn't isn't there for them basically, because I've had roles before where the manager has been kind of a little bit too overbearing. Um and you you don't want to go to those people with your issues and concerns because you're not sure how they're going to treat them. Um So I think that's a really good skill required and I'd say that's pretty much kind of what I believe that I can bring to the table. So thank you very much for your time.

Um I do a lot of operational projects and usually the manager where I incorporate best practices and innovative approaches and everything relies on communication skills. So I've been responsible at my job in the entertainment industry for designing very complex lighting projects while I worked closely with producers, directors talent, um many that are nationally televised have been the head lighting designer for many band projects on shows and I also know how to work with the team. I've been the guy hanging the lights and programming the board and operating it. So I know everything from the top down, as far as roles go. Um I have to always use best possible practices to get the results that I need. Um And I'm always part of a diverse workforce which I feel is important nowadays. Ah it's just being culturally sensitive to people and understanding differences and just trying to inspire and guide my teams to get the highest level of performance. Um And I also work on the music side as well as the lighting and I began as an assistant to audio engineer. So I had to hustle and learn that before moving up to overseeing album production, songwriting, recording, mixing, producing, release. So in my independent work that I do outside of when I manage these projects for lighting, I am completely in charge of these projects, it's the artists and I sitting down producing, coming up with the best possible sound. Um I have to achieve these goals under tight deadlines and it's very dependent on our relationship, There's a lot of trust that goes into it because these musicians want to have, you know, this is their passion, this is their baby. And it's up to me to produce world class performances with them. Um on top of that, I understand the business side, there's the art side. But in order to make the project a reality, I have to implement business practices and regulatory practices to get these needs copyrights. I SRC codes, budgeting artwork clearance all samples for the music depending on what type of music we do. Um and again, it goes back to communication. So I have to exceed these defined objectives and give the best possible project. And then before I got into this career, my job was in sales. I worked at a computer sales store where customer service was key. I had to deliver optimal customer service while assisting computer customers and building computers. So I had to know the technological side, stay up to date with it and then use what I, the knowledge that I gained to build the right computer for people. Um, and as part of the sales team, we worked collaboratively to hit our goals. So we had metrics we had to reaching each month and of course there's a lot of individual performance, but to really succeed and have the whole department hit their goal. We all had to work together and just continuing to build knowledge for specifications of these evolving computers as I'm sure you're aware, technology changes every day and it's very important to stay up to date and things. So with all that said, I've had a variety of roles and I think the time management is key. You see my current job working live performances, typed deadlines that I have to reach customer service people. And I listed all these jobs to kind of, you know, stress to you that I've been from the very bottom as an engineer or a salesperson to the top and I was in charge of a nationally broadcast debate on Tv. I did the lighting for it. So high pressure, high stakes and I succeeded. Everyone was happy.

I am a lecturer at the University of the Arts in London at the London College of Fashion and you want to know about my leadership abilities. Well, few things I would like to say, first of all, um I'm a very positive person and I think the leadership and positivity go hand in hand because it's all about getting the best out of people. A lot has been written about good transactional leadership, the idea of introducing people and helping them. I always do that. I bring that to any work I do. Um unlike management, I'm not obsessed with process, I'm not obsessed with detail. Two more obsessed with is getting the best out of people. And that doesn't mean to say that I don't want to get the jobs done because I do and everyone I've managed so far has actually been quite productive. And the reason for that, because I don't I don't have this air of authority, I want to tell people what to do by the basis of my position. I get the best out of people by positivity, good vibes, um and rewarding people in intrinsic ways, just letting them know that they're valued, that they're important, that they're part of a team and things go wrong. People make mistakes, recognizing that people are human and using it as a learning opportunity and that's the way I the way I've really worked throughout my professional career made mistakes and I think the good thing about leadership is learning from mistakes as well because we've done a lot from things we felt that You know, I've been electorate for 25 years, I have a PhD and all that stuff, but I didn't do very well at school and I progressed, I kept going and I've actually got where I am at the moment, so you know, you can get there, it's just, it's just, you just have to be tenacious and my, my being tenacious is really, you know, I think that's my big leadership skill. The other thing I would say is I'm pretty emotionally intelligent, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm very mindful of how I regulate my emotions. I'm very mindful of how to motivate people. I'm very mindful of showing empathy to people. I'm very mindful of being aware of my own emotions as well. I think really important and that's a good quality to get the best out of people. And the other thing is I think the leadership, I don't give up, you know, I always, if I want to in any line of work I'm involved with, if I want to do something, I'd see it through to the end and I might make mistakes, I might have issues on the way as everyone does life gets in the way. But hey, we learn from that, we move on. So yeah, that's how I define myself as later, somewhat transactional leader. We're good qualities of emotional intelligence humor I think is important as well, you know, and getting the best out of people. So there you go. So that is a little bit about me and that's who I am and I will of course be willing to share um this information with anyone who wants to hear all about me and go from there really. So yeah, that's really want to know what to say about leadership. I suppose the one other thing I would say about leadership is this, um I think when we need, we leave from not the top, it's not what we do, when we get to the top, it's what we do and we're at the bottom. I think that defines who we are with people, you know, when you've been through bad times, when things aren't going right, when, you know, workers are going the way you'd like to life gets in the way it's how you keep going and how you deal with that. And actually, I would also say that telling stories is an important part of leadership as well. True stories that emphasis how people get to where they are and I've been my leadership because coming two ways really, I've helped students a lot, you know, get through there exams. I've even examined up to PhD level five phds and that was that was that was difficult in itself because I had to positively talk about what aspects of someone's research made it worthy of that kind of recognition. I've but I've also help students with their projects and really tried to get the best out of people by showing what people can do what people can learn. Because some of the fundamental beliefs that everyone is good at something, you just have to find out what that something is. And yeah, that's how I that's how I've led. Okay, So yeah, there we go. I think that's all about me. So we're coming to the end now, so I'm, yeah, nice to meet you all and yeah, take care. Thank you. Bye bye.

Um I currently have line management responsibilities as well as also managing a variety of different projects across the department I work in. Um So currently I have indirect line management of five individuals who I can allocate to different projects and different bodies of work. Um That that I lead on as I'm currently a project manager in my current role, I'm also expecting in the next couple of months to take on direct line management of one of the, one of the colleagues within the team. Um Prior to this current role, I mean at the moment I've supervised a team of, I'd say about 10 people working within the hospitality setting. My role was to allocate out different duties, oversee the performance of their work, check quality of their work and make sure that they were meeting the uh well, meeting the behavioral expectations that we had within the wrong and the team. Um When I started in that role, I noted that there was some behaviors and some practical uh some attitudes within the team that I felt was unacceptable. Um So during my first week or two of working within that role, I opted to leave early um and offered to my colleagues that they could finish early if they wanted or they could work out their shift. Um Obviously if they finished early, they would not receive payment for the time as they had elected not to finish their shift. I then left the left the workplace. Um But as soon as I got to, you know, the place where I was going, I immediately called security and checked whether they had in fact stayed or whether they had gone, I found that they had in fact actually gone. Um and so when I saw them on the next working day, I challenged him and said, well, you know, did you leave or did you not leave? And they said that they had stayed to, which I said, well, I spoke to security, um they have told me that you did in fact leave. Um so, you know, again, I didn't pursue the matter, I went and spoke to my manager about it and he said that he didn't feel it was worth challenging that type of behavior to which I kind of came to the conclusion that, well, there's no point fighting battles that, you know, the more senior management in what was to fight. So I took a different approach. So, um, you know, one of the colleagues that had left that day, I tried to support her personal development by getting her to more supervisory level, because I felt that the reason that she'd become complacent, that she felt undervalued in the workplace. So, I supported her in that respect. Another one of the guys lied, he had actually previously been uh, censured for stealing, he hadn't actually steal stole, it was a hospitality environment and when stuff's gonna go in the bin, people tend to eat it rather than threaten to been, but the, the colleagues there or the management had decided to pursue that as kind of a theft thing, you know? Which I tried to provided him with some support saying, look, I'm on your side, you know, and I understand that you're not stolen anything, I mean if you want to take home a big wheel of cheese at the end of the day, that's gonna go on out of date, that's alright. But we need to, I guess think of a process for this wastage to be accounted for. Another one of the guys there that had kind of behavioral attitudes I supported and actually was his personal statement right for his application to go to university because he said he wanted to do something different, I guess, knowing that I wasn't able to use the stick method to support an improvement in behaviors of the team, um I adopted the carrot method of trying to give them things. They wanted to co opt their support during the time that I worked in, that team went from the lost leading. So we were reading are regulated cost, you know, cost measures to making profit significant profit. Um and also that the staff were much happier. Um the client was happier because the staff were working harder and the reputation was much improved. So um so yeah, that was one particular role where I've demonstrated I'd say positive leadership skills, I'm not afraid of having challenging conversations are difficult conversations with people and I will not suffer fools gladly, fools. Gladly, I'm a fool. So you know, I know all the tricks. Um but I would rather, if at all possible try and improve the quality of the workforce by up skilling them, supporting them because, you know, we all function, we want the same things I want to be successful, we want to do well, um you know, where that's not possible or where attitude, you know, exists, I'm canny enough, um driven enough to be willing to enable, to challenge that and, you know, the key, the key things that I do have done in my management roles are trying to improve profitability and the quality of service to our clients.

So um my current role I don't have to do much managing although um as I'm only been employed for about a year but um I do have to do some um level of teamwork and and kind of deciding in which direction to go for my job. Um I'm a physicist so I work in kind of an engineering field um And um I there have been industrial placement students so people who have come from university for the year as well as um people from um who are doing a summer placement so it's like an internship and I've spent time um talking to them and bringing them up to speed so that they can be useful members of the team. Um So for example I have to show them how to do things in the lab, I have to help them run experiments. So I've done that a fair bit and as well as not only just physically kind of showing them how to do mechanical things but also um teaching them um certain physics principles. So um if often times students will come in and they won't have had um experience from their university degree in the stuff that they do in at my work. So I have to tell them what kind of you know physics things to study up on and point them in the correct direction for which textbooks to look at. Another thing that is useful, kind of helped my managerial um uh leadership skills um is that I play a lot of football. Um And at university I was captain of the physics football team. Um and that took a lot of leadership because I had to um I had to run training sessions, I had to ensure that everyone had paid the correct money in order to part of the team and um and I had to organize with the student Union and with the football league so that everyone could, you know, have a fee, a fun, safe and competitive environment too, enjoy playing football and. Mhm. So um that was um good. Um also before that, another kind of leadership position I've held was also I was captain of my school's football team. Now that's going back a bit further, that also was a great honor and I was the first person at my school to be captain, Not in their senior year, so in when I was 17 as well as when I was 18 I was the school's captain and I lead them to football tournaments um out of the country. So we visited places like Vienna and Milan and played football there.

Hello thank you for having me in this job interview. Um I'm here to interview for the role of manager. And the reason why I'm here is because I believe that I have what it takes to be a manager or company here and as the managing position and if you give me a few minutes here I'll just tell you I'll just run over why I think that would be a good fit for the role. So first of all I believe that as someone who's been working here before, I understand all the different ins and outs of how the company works from almost every single different role. Now. Why? That's good as a manager's role is that um it makes me very empathetic towards the other employees. You know, if I'm going to tell someone to do something, I have a rough idea of how much time it's going to take. And I also know how they're gonna feel if I tell them to take a little bit longer. You know, nobody likes to be told that they only have five minutes on a certain task or uh you know they're told to do a task that's really difficult and they're the only one doing it. So that's one of the traits that I feel like I have is that I would be empathetic towards other towards my fellow employees and the people working under me. Another thing that I feel like I would bring to the table would mean that I would be a good communicator. Um I would be able to talk to people in a friendly tone. I'm not just talking down to people but talking alongside people and I think this is really good from leaders point of view because you don't want to just be pushing people around. You want to be guiding people you know you want them to be following you and if you can't communicate with them it's just gonna be terrible. Um I think as a as a managing role I feel like I would be quite strategic. Um Not I mentioned earlier about being empathetic but I think that in order you can only be so empathetic about certain things. You know if you spend too long especially in a managing position if you spend too long ah you know letting people get on your on your emotional side it can it can be sometimes the bad thing for the business so you need to balance out what's good for the business and what's good for the employees and you need to make sure that you find the right balance there because otherwise people will just like push you around and they'll just ask for days off and they'll they'll do these things when they know that they're not actually sick. Um And that's not good for a manager's point of view and that brings me onto one of my other points here is that I would be accountable. So one thing one thing is making a mistake and another thing is admitting that you've made a mistake and that you're actually willing to you know, own up to it and really just yeah, just own up to it and explain two people what you've done, what you've done it, you know, genuinely most of the time it's an honest mistake, it's not it's not something that was done to be deceptive, so as long as you're accountable, I feel like that keeps the trust from the employees a lot more. Um And finally I just feel like I would be a good suit to the company as all these all these different points here. Ah they kind of add up to be someone who looks after the business, someone who at the same time looks after the employees and I think it's it's someone who's very responsible but yet understands the full task of what we're doing here at the business. Um And that's the most important thing is someone who just understands uh the the end to end product creation, you know, how we're how we get things in and how we take things out. Um And yeah I think that I'm the right suit for the role, I think that I could bring a good uh good sense of strategy to the board and I'm always future forward looking as well. Ah and I think that's that's what's definitely needed in a management position.

Um So just talking a little bit about my management experience over the years, so I've led teams for about 3.5 to 4 years. Some of the main things that I've done Over those years are leading an operations team from a team of just myself to what's now a team of eight. So one of the main things that I I really like to do as a kind of team leader in the management position is really growing people. Um so people are my focus and have been for the past three years or so. Um So looking back and just starting out as a as a leader, some of the big things that I worked a lot on our communication and project management, um so one of the best things that I ever did was take a project management course throughout that course in university I learned a lot of the kind of critical skills of project management and leadership. It really pulled into kind of my working career um by using those skills, was able to Really leverage the team and the best way possible. So we're a fairly small company with about 200 and 250 employees, so a lot of the projects that we do work on our cross collaborative in nature, um which really it's important that you're able to communicate to the team priorities and how to set priorities and making sure that the team is in a position to know what they should be working on. Um So one of the big things that I've worked on with the team as well as setting up a priority framework. Um this framework really is set up in a way to calculate both the effort required as well as the time and that's something you can take. Um But also looking at the overall impact of what that work is. Um So it has a number of different kind of fields, it's built in excel inputs of your time hours um as well as what's the expected outcome you're looking for? Um So we're primarily an operations team, working with different teams like marketing, sales, customer success operations, so a lot of the things that we enable affect your customers and we're able to put a dollar value to that so we can easily estimate the output gain from any projects. So I think this really has helped the team really speaks to kind of the importance of time management, project management and really being able to set priorities as a team. Um So that's another thing that I've been working on um in addition to that, one of the main things I think that has been great for the team that I've been working on as well, It's just the focus on professional development, so really helping team members understand opportunities for growth internally and really painting a picture for them and then allowing them to understand what they're working towards and then picking apart different options or things that they can do to get to where they're trying to go. Mhm. One of the things that I've always appreciated um that leaders that I looked up to dead was just providing kind of a framework or or guidance of what to what to do um what to think about as you look for an opportunity for growth. So I've really tried to mimic that behavior for my team and help them understand really what what they can do to become a better employee, improve those skills, their abilities and um just deliver more value to the company. So as a leader, I really focus on those types of areas and that's all I've got for you today.",NEUTRAL,0.3412,0.0185,0.637,0.0033,629.0,MED,9,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),9.549999,0,1,0,"Bachelor's degree (e.g. BA, BS)",Male,8.530964,8.856119,8.930445

I appreciate the opportunity to talk to you about the role I'm taking on in uh my satellite communications field. Network Operations center Manager. I've performed that role in the past. And I'd like to go over a little bit my leadership capabilities and managing capabilities and overall what my uh, what my skill set is to match up with your needs. I'm fairly, highly skilled and all of the areas of global communications, satellite fiber optic. Ah I ran the network operations center in Australia for a multinational government facility and we oversaw broadband satellite and fiber optic systems and managed a staff Of approximately 15-20 operators, technicians and engineers. But in addition to manage those, I also was the primary satellite engineer for handling about 16 satellite trembles and systems. And also the final in country technical support. My leadership style is one where I try to get everybody performing at their best and pushing themselves to uh learn more and do more of their what they're capable of. Uh not such that they're stressed and uh you know, I feel like they can't handle it. But basically as a continuously learning capabilities. So I'm really focused on trying to get the best out of the individuals uh and giving them the responsibilities to show me what they can do and promote the ones, especially that show that they are capable of much more and try to develop those that need more skill sets and learning capabilities. Uh I'd like to be able to get a consensus of information and then make the decisions necessary to to maximize our our abilities and systems. Mm hmm. Overall I really enjoy a diverse work set, enjoy being able to manage the staff and also going into the high levels detailed technical when necessary. I want to let the individuals um do their jobs. But when it's reached the point that they're they're coming to me saying we were no longer able, we can't do it. We need more support. Then I'll bring my my capabilities in help them proceed. And if necessary. Since we're a global systems work in country with somebody in a distant point such as back in the United States or some other another country in point and get the expertise needed uh to demonstrate that um as I said, it's a global global network. One of my goals early on when I first took the role of network operations center Manager was to develop the trust and the support of the distant in facilities. Very early on, it was apparent that a lot of individuals and facilities really wanted to point the finger at the other end. I got it such that our our staff and our facility was known for being upfront and forthright. And if we had the issue on our end letting everybody know that was the issue. So I want to trust to be there uh and through that I was able to develop at all the different facilities. Trust with the managers there and the staff there that when we said this is what was occurring, they trusted us that that was the case uh, and will work with us really well. So my style is to put in as much effort as possible, uh and try to do the best you can, but also to work within reasonable bounds. Uh, I don't expect people to come in and work 20 hour days everyday there. They should work their best during their normal shifts. Uh, that way they know what to expect that I expect them to work the best they can. Also expect them to then Have their own time off. I'm not trying to be in communications with them 24 hours a day. So, uh, overall my leadership is trying to bring everybody in to do their best, but not to overwork them or exhaust them to, to the point that they cannot continue in the long term. It's a long term goal for me in all cases. Oh, so I'm hoping that this will do well. And I look forward to working with in your organization and developing the staff and the facilities to the maximum extent that we can.

Thank you very much for taking the time out To listen to my request to apply for this position as a manager. I feel that I am the right person for this job because I have been in this role for several years and I feel like it is time for me to step up and show that I'm capable of doing more, have experience of management in my career as well as my out of my life outside of my career.

I also feel that my masters in psychology and mental health is also relevant for me applying as a manager in this company dealing with mental health and people with mental health issues. I have been with this company for five years, I have stuck with this company through thick and thin, there's been several times where have not been happy with certain matters and even through the pandemic it was very hard. But I'd like to think that I've always put in 110%. I'd like to think that I'm always thinking of new ways to this business can drive.

It appears as well as superiors clients, um mixed colleague and client teams as well as sometimes actually being teams which have people from my own company as well as people from other companies. Which is quite challenging because they are quite often in fact are competitors and I've done that very successfully over the years, having often been selected to lead teams. One particular example I'm very proud of, I was in a nine country consortium to develop a program of research around forestry development throughout the EU EU. And within that I was part of the steering group with the other members of the multinational consortium. It was led by a french research institute, so I was interacting them with them in french. So I was steering the direction of the research myself, but then I had responsibly for the United Kingdom input for the study. So I was leading teams made up from colleagues within my company, as well as specialist college people from other companies and I had to to direct ship motivate their outputs as well as bringing it together in a sort of cohesive whole. And I think those are very important skills in terms of leadership, being able to direct, being able to drive things forward, but also to be able to motivate people to do that and to have a skill set of skills of how you can motivate people because some people respond to different sorts of motivation, some people, it might be about money, some people, it might be about the intellectual challenge. Some people actually, it might be about the fact that if they don't do the work they're going to get um a bad mark. So it's very important that one can bring disparate groups as a leader together, drive them forward to a successful outcome, which everyone can feel they have had a chance to participate and can walk away from it feeling that they have done well. Um So I said I've I've done that for many years across a range of different um companies um and what have what have I done in terms of leadership, So I've been responsible for developing the skills of colleagues um but with within my own organization, as well as within other organizations measuring their development, pulling together the types of skills they will need for different roles and at different levels. Um also for their own personal development, I've been responsible for leading the personal development of a number of my colleagues. Um In addition I have had over the years practice development targets um which I have been responsible for leading and shaping very important again, to be self reliant to be able to drive things forward to have clear objectives, clear outcomes that I'm trying to get and to bring people with me to do that because I can develop the products to some extent by myself, but I always need input from others in terms of complementary skills or if they need lots of um inputs which would be too good for myself, too big for myself. Um So that's been excuse me, A very, very important um part of that sort leadership is about motivating yourself, but motivating others, it's about not being afraid to take big decisions or sometimes unpopular decisions and it's about bringing colleagues with you whether they totally buy into the decisions or not because at the end of the day as a leader I will have responsibility for the final outputs and their final outcomes. But if I haven't brought my team with me then I won't have motivated them to do that, then I wouldn't have been a successful leader myself.

Um I was able to capitalize on these and inter management fairly early. Um I began with Hyatt Hotels here in Austin texas and ah my manager there, jennifer, we'll leave out the last name was really excellent and um, mm hmm. Reputation within the industry was definitely instrumental in my success. Unfortunately in 2012 I had to move back home to beaumont Texas to after a motorcycle accident and once I learned how to walk again, I was able to accept the management position at the Holiday Inn there. It's the largest building in the city. So that was exciting. Um, but after about two years I was able to move back to Austin um taking on a project as general manager to remodel a defunct roadway and property. And I learned a lot during that opportunity. It was not something I would ever do again, but I was often the only person on site that was employed. Um, so I was everything. It was very enlightening opportunity. I've learned things I will never forget from there. Um After that I began working again at the Holiday Inn. Austin airport location. I was able to move our property to number one on Tripadvisor for the entire time I was employed at the location. Um Following this, I opened the Austin Hotel Indigo with intercontinental hotels and resorts in downtown, um, where I remain to this day. However, after everything that's happened with Covid and transitioning the product property through that, I do feel that it is time for me to explore a different industry. I am not confident in the future of the hospitality industry as it formerly existed and I would like to explore what I would considered to be more stable opportunities going forward and I feel that I can bring my experience with the hospitality industry over to your industry as well. Um, I would be remiss if I did not mention my volunteer ventures, I was able to assist with starting Austin's harm reduction coalition, which opened the city's first mobile needle exchange, um, providing safety and testing for those who inject drugs.

Um I do have some management experience in the past. Back when I was younger before I joined the full time workforce, I did work as a shift supervisor pizza hut. So I did have a bit of direct people management experience back then. Um and it was always exciting for me like I always loved the rasta ring and shift patterns and keeping everyone, you know coming to work motivated and efficiently and serving customers. More recently I've been involved in a couple of roles that have been have management and leadership skills that I have had to use in my job. I've done project management where I used to organize and plan these jobs which involved large groups of people doing various tasks, some of which were quite dangerous and could have resulted in fatalities if not done correctly. So I used to have to organize these groups. All these individuals planned the entire job and supervised the job whilst it was taking place to make sure everyone is doing the exact right thing at the right time to make sure people get in and out of the tunnel safely. That took a bit of leadership skills. Despite the fact that wasn't technically in a leadership role, it required me to speak to people at various levels from engineers through too. General tradespeople. Fruit and management themselves. So that that was probably where I gained a lot of my experience, my leadership experience in the workforce and it was certainly a good job to do. I love doing it. We'd be working anytime from regular business hours to, you know, one am starts because we had to plan jobs around certain sewer flows. It was always interesting to me more recently, I'm involved in business performance and I'm involved with the corporate performance side of things, which basically means that I am responsible for reporting the performance of the business at a corporate level, but also at a group level. So I currently work with a couple of the group's two of the largest groups in our company. And I not only put their reports together every month, but I have to talk through them in the performance meetings each month. Not only just talk through the reports, but I have to analyze the reports, spend a lot of time previously to sort of identify areas for opportunity. Now I'm talking to the executive, I've even talked to the board for our company and I need to provide recommendations for specific courses of action to watch for certain items of interest items that are at risk and basically help plot a course forward doing that. Despite the fact I'm not in a management role itself does require a a degree of leadership skills and that is something that I'm working on. And I actually intend to focus on quite heavily this year if I'm going to be honest, but using these skills, I can then apply to a management role in my company. I believe that my prior people management skills, both in the project management role and also in my previous job back in fast food and takeaway, they apply for the people management side. I'll be able to pick up the technical details. I mean that's something that there's no dramas. I'll work out the systems how to approve, believe how to talk about how to do all the admin tasks, I'm not too worried about that. Um but encouraging people to work, finding out ways forward, trying to speak to people, get different ideas for solutions, try to chart the way forward. That's something that I believe I can do based on my previous management experience and it's something that I'm really looking forward to giving an attempt to try in this particular role. I think I'm the right person for the job. I don't think you want someone who's just been a manager their whole life and nothing else. I think you want someone with a bit of ground experience who knows not only how to talk to managers, how to talk to people and how to do things without that preconceived notion of what I know is right because quite often it's not you just got to talk to people, you gotta go listen to people and um yeah, use use some skills, use some insight.

Um but I was also still their manager and I had to make sure that everything went smoothly that everyone had the right resources that they needed and the information that they needed, information needed to successfully complete their part of the project and then at the end I had to kind of compile all those things together and make sure that everything flowed well and fit together well, um and that we met those deadlines um and and finish the project to success, um you know, so in the same vein I'm not, you know, afraid of, of, you know, of doing the same work that, you know, my team members are doing and being getting hands on every day and and being directly there and making sure that the work gets done on my end as well. Um but at the same time, I'm also not afraid to delegate. I know that, you know, it's important for a manager to be able to um except that there are certain things that they need to be doing and certain things that they don't need to be doing and that, you know, you have to be mindful of where your efforts are best um needed for the success of the project. Um and so I think that's really important skill that I learned in my previous experience, um in addition to that, that there comes the, the idea of a manager having to know, you know, what the priorities are for the full project and what is important to keep in scope um in terms of not delegate, not um, you know, asking too much of your team members and and making sure that everybody who has, you know, there's a part of the project can fulfill that part of the project without feeling like they have too much on their plate or feeling like that whatever they're tackling or whatever project or a job that they've been given for this specific project is something that they feel confident in and they feel that they can, you know, create and meet successfully. Um and so it's an important part of being a manager to understand your team and really know your team members and understand the project and understand like what is the best connection between team and project and and where each member fits successfully. Um and in that vein as well, I think I think I do a pretty good job of making sure that my team feels confident and feels encouraged in their work, I like to really make sure that my team morale is good and that everybody feels like they're welcomed in the workspace and that they have exactly what they need to get the job done well. Um and with that comes, you know, you know, the importance of communication, clear communication and just making sure that the team members know what their job is, you know, what they need to know when they need to do it and and know that at the end of it, that I make sure to communicate, you know, what was great and what they did really successfully and hopefully, you know, to encourage them and motivate them to do that again and be able to build upon those successes. Um And also, you know, being critical not in a way that, you know, brings anybody down, but also but just in a way that really addresses what maybe could be improved, you know later on including in myself, you know, being able to self reflect and do the same thing that I do for my team for myself. And so I think those are some of the qualities that I have um and that I've and some of the knowledge and experience that I've gained in my time managing similar teams in a similar role um that would make me a great fit for this for this um position as manager.",POSITIVE,0.7136,0.0038,0.2812,0.0014,891.0,HIGH,12,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),12.73,0,1,0,"Bachelor's degree (e.g. BA, BS)",Male,9.501223,9.813995,9.675611

People have always followed me in life and I'm just very very good at motivating people and I'm still a little leader and like every aspect of my life not just like work, my involvement in the community shows how I'm a leader because I just genuinely like care about people and I will organize events especially neighborhood events, block parties and things like that.

Uh and I would like to outline my experiences and skills that I believe lend well to this position. So firstly this management role is a technical role um and I know that this role will be leading an analytical team, so I believe it's vital to have someone who has that technical knowledge and experience already. Um and over the last 10 years I've kind of built up my analytical experience within the field and throughout my roles I've had a technical um technical aspect to everything I've been doing. So in my first role, working with a large professional services firm, I've built up my best practices and dealing with data leading from, you know, folder structures, logical approach to data sets and I've taken those best practices whilst working at this firm as well um from a specific programming perspective, I have sequel knowledge, visualization tools and some python knowledge as well. And I believe, you know, you need to have someone in that management position who knows for those technical um aspects so they can lead the team of analysts and no exactly what they're talking about, so you can lead the team from a project perspective. Um and I'm really passionate about data insights um and that's why I want to apply for this role. Um think data is very important organizations and that's my passion to drive insight from data and to drive strategy um from a stakeholder management perspective, I think another key aspect to this role. Um I've demonstrated that whilst working at this company already um I have been leading proactive projects to drive change and I've been acting as kind of a project manager already um and you know throughout through my project have demonstrated my success with that. Um and through these projects have also built up a good network of stakeholders across the business and as a management in the management role. I think this is crucial, especially when we are trying to drive change within the business um to have that network and relationships makes it a whole much a whole lot easier. Um I guess in the industry in addition to the state Quantum management, obviously I've been leading the team as well as the most experienced higher within the team over the last year, I've already you know, taken kind of the less experienced members of the team under my wing and developing them and providing direction to them but to them in their projects as well. Um And again, I think that's a key aspect of the management role as well when leading leading teams, which I've had experience with already and which I'm doing already. Um And I guess another point around what I think is important to the management role is a round structure and organization. So ask I would say that's one of my key strengths here and that's what I've brought in since joining last year, I've put in place a key key organization um aspects to the team such as jerry boards and agile methodologies and I believe that has really pay dividends in the way we are working um and allow us to work in a more compliant uh, structure. Um, and I think is key, especially in this fast paced environment that we work in, that management stay on top of everything that's going on and no. Uh, and that allows them to kind of drive the project so much better in a more organized fashion. Um, so I hope you agree that kind of the skills and experience that I've outlined today um are aligned to what uh kind of imagine management needs to be.

Um I think the most essential or one of the most essential aspects of effective leadership is being able to be a leader by example and by service as opposed to dictatorial top down decision maker philosophies of leadership. I think that's essential in certain instances but as as far as my field of education is concerned, it's been hugely beneficial to foster a culture of collaboration and support as opposed to people coming with me with concerns or situations that need to be resolved that I make in the final decision and then we move forward. So it takes a lot more time and effort to do to to create a professional culture of collaboration. But I think that it's essential in order to to build a professional community that is uh progressive, that that is safe and and something that is that allows us to move forward in a way that that would benefit those that we work for meaning our students. So when I when I get together with with teams and when I'm when I'm evaluating or speaking that it's very, very important for those that I work with to know that there's a culture of collaboration that they feel like they can voice their opinions even if they differ from my my opinions and feel like they've been heard, it doesn't necessarily mean that we that we move in a different direction, but it allows us to to generate a culture that is comfortable in its own skin and leadership team that allow us for um constructive criticism and maybe even a little dissent to the point that that we can without without being hostile, but I feel that it's really, really important to be a leader that is comfortable enough to recognize the value of others and to create situations where they feel like they're heard, it becomes hugely beneficial, especially if you move in a direction that that those, those ah faculty or staff members disagree with, because at the very least if, if they feel comfortable, they feel like they've been heard, even if we move in a different direction, they have that buy in to where they, they feel like it's even though they're moving in a different direction that they feel supported and and they feel like they've been heard and and oftentimes it allows for, for me as that leader to recognize a different opinion and maybe even change what what we're doing to something that's better because of the experiences or the differing opinions of others.",NEUTRAL,0.4719,0.0103,0.5173,0.0005,654.0,HIGH,12,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),7.94,0,1,0,"Master's degree (e.g. MA, MS, MEd)",Male,8.986052,9.309504,9.334517

Um And then in a about 150 lawyer law firm I was with, I became the head of the corporate department there which put me in charge of Around nine partner level attorneys and about 10 or so associate level attorneys, three paralegals and all the staff that worked with us. And I was actually the formal leader of that group. Um Law firms are interesting because there's a higher, there's not real hierarchy. Every partner likes to believe that they're in charge. Um Obviously it doesn't operate that way. Um So you do have some formality and having a managing partner and a committee. Um So I would interact directly with those people is necessary. But there's a lot of politicking that had to go on because people are valued on other basis how much business they have, how much they control seniority, what have you. So I'd have to work with everyone. And on the management side I had to assist my team who they didn't necessarily work directly for me. They worked for the partners whose transactions they were working on. But I was in charge of the morale and the staffing of the group. So I had to figure out ways to deal with problems caused by individual personalities. Um Work with what I had to adjust that. Um And I enjoyed it. It was fulfilling. Um, I find it interesting. I had the fire three of the associate attorneys because of a down economy and every single one of them stayed on great terms with me afterwards. They wanted to have even better careers and one of them steam of students at a large university. So, um, that's great. And that makes me feel good. Someone I was not sure about come up to me. I had a reception a year or so afterwards and she came right up to me and gave me a big hug and you know, told me I had done a really great job. So I think that speaks all to my management skills. I've always done well secretaries and people working under me. And most recently I did some stuff, some weird jobs because I'm out of practice of law and I work for a health care insurance company and We had a training group of about 25 people and they nominated me as the valedictorian of the group because of my efforts in trying to assist the others in the class. And, and we're sort of bridging the cap with people for the various weaknesses.

Um so with regards to my leadership abilities and skills, I would say that the first signs of my leadership abilities and skills coming through was in primary school, when I was selected to be one of the leaders, part of like the student, a student body of leaders, just to make sure that we are enforcing the different school rules in the different areas during break times. You know, we were assigned different posts and we would make sure that we keeping an eye on all the students, making sure that all the students are behaving in an orderly fashion and following the rules and would be responsible to report if anything was amiss. Um That also then progressed into me becoming a captain in the school teams in the sports that I played. There was another instance where I started to really see my leadership abilities coming forth. Rather the coaches saw it in me and helped me step into those positions are encouraged me rather to step into those positions. Um my leadership abilities did not just, we're not just limited to school, should I say it also, they really came through in my friendships and my relationships. Um, with my friends, we started a music group where we danced and recorded music and I just found myself taking up a bit of a leadership position most of the time. Either I'm the one who's taking a lead on the kind of music that will be recorded or taking a lead on the, on when the practice times will be happening. We're taking a lead on organizing events or gigs and any other marketing material that we might have needed for us to fulfill our agenda as entertainers. But yeah, for the most part, um, and then I find myself in the workplace, whenever it doesn't matter what job I'm in, I easily find myself climbing the ranks. I mean my very first job was actually I was um hired to be a supervisor as opposed to the first level, which was hawkers and and people that were cashier, so to speak. My very first job, I was hired to be a supervisor because my leadership skills just schoen right through, you know, it was undeniable that I'm in a position and I'm able to motivate people and I think that's definitely my strongest quality as a leader, my ability to keep people motivated, my ability to keep hope on the horizon for the people that I am leading per se or the people that I'm working with and having me in that leadership position. And that's just one that's one of the main factors of my leadership abilities, but I do believe that I have the excellent listening skills, I have the patience, you know, to be a leader. You need a lot of patients because not everybody is on a level, not everybody moves at the same pace or even at your pace, so you have to understand how to work with different people in different circumstances at, at different times, at different paces, because if you try to have a one size fits all type of approach, it will actually frustrate you as a leader and frustrate those who are following you or those who look up to you, so to speak. But yeah, there's so many instances I could think of, you know, and I'm just grateful that leadership comes naturally to me because it's something that is important as um first of all, I was born being a first born, you know, as a firstborn. So I do believe that me being a leader was well within my destiny from the moment that I was born simply for the fact that I was born as a first born, and I think that was my true first experience of leadership, being an older brother, you know, and then progressed into the schools and the sports and the workplace, and I do believe that um I look forward to actually exploring more of my capabilities and abilities as a leader with your organization. And I do believe that I would be a perfect fit to, not only in part but to also receive and learn and grow, because the greatest part about being a leader is not only in helping other people grow, but it also growing yourself, you know, and you know what they say, the best way to learn is to teach, and that's why I happily take up a role to be a leader, not because I think I'm better than anyone, but because I'm willing to go the extra mile to help those who might be, we might not be able to keep up as as quick as the rest of us May may thank you.",NEUTRAL,0.2554,0.0445,0.6975,0.0026,811.0,LOW,3,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),15.47,0,1,0,"Bachelor's degree (e.g. BA, BS)",Male,8.923821,9.241443,9.088136

Um I have been a supervisor now for about five years and I think that uniquely qualifies me for a managerial position because I have been uh in a leadership role uh for several years now and I would like to start with some of my uh findings and what I've learned being in such a role for the past few years. And the biggest thing that I would like to speak about right now is communication. I've learned that over the years. Communication is a huge huge thing when you are basically trying to lead people into getting the job done and getting the job done correctly. Um What I've learned is that not everybody articulates everything the same, not everybody learns the same way. So when you communicate to your employees especially when you recognize some of your employees are different than the others are certain employees, you should say things in a certain type of way versus another group of employees. So like um what I learned was it's one thing to like know what the job is and to ah tell the workers what needs to get done. It's another thing to actually make them understand what the job is and how to get it done. You know so being able to kind of like articulate what really is going on, not just you know throw the boxes over there but you know hey these boxes and this grid and these you know sequence. You know you gotta learn how to communicate all this information in such a way that they will understand as well. So you gotta kind of um just kind of go over the information and think about your employees and say okay so if I tell them this and this this way I think they'll totally get the message and I only really have to relay the information once. Another thing that I learned was being able to delegate responsibilities a lot of times um employees will lose motivation and they'll get you know you know a little bit of a temper if you will so delicate. I learned that delegating responsibilities to employees actually motivates them and makes them actually want to work harder better especially when they know they're doing a good job and it could lead to pay raise promotion whatever down the line, you know a good review. So delegation isn't just to make my job easier as a manager or as a supervisor that I am now will be manager hopefully if you hire me but it's also to motivate my employees too, you know do a better job to to keep them motivated to uh make them want to do better and then you know, so it's not just for me it's not just for the company but it's for them as well because the more they want to do better, the better uh workers there will be and the better assets they will be for the company and of course it will lead to positive outcomes down the line. So um um I I think that my experience so far with leading people uniquely qualifies me to be in the manager physician because I learned how to deal with people, I learned how to assess people with the strengths and weaknesses, so I don't know what jobs I can delegate to, which person to effectively get the job done quicker and faster and how to relay information. So it limits confusion or any type of complications also. Um I listened to feedback, you know, not not every job is going to be the same and sometimes there may be problems that I'm not privy of or I don't understand because I'm not necessarily standing right next to them doing a job. So I do listen and take what they have to say into strong consideration because it does affect the job and I do want to know what's going on and I want to do everything I can to not only make the job easier for my employees but to also get the job done. So I learned how to actively listen and problem solve. Plus with that comes with giving constructive feedback as well, so if some employees are falling short or if there's a mistake, I'm not just going to get mad at them, I learned that I can give them constructive feedback in such a way where it's not gonna make anybody upset but it will help them understand and want to move forward adequately",POSITIVE,0.4845,0.0443,0.4616,0.0096,775.0,HIGH,12,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),12.98,0,1,0,"Associate degree (e.g. AA, AS)",Male,10.58928,10.89715,10.94852

Um I've been in the industry for about five years now and moved into a managerial position about two years ago, just one year into my time at the company and with that said, I have had experience managing and leading working groups and not just in my current role, but also my previous role on projects ranging from financial projects, including an IPO and private placement, too long range plans and deal analysis for licensing and channel distribution. My role is very heavily commercial focus now and that's demands connectivity with many areas of the company, including sales, strategy, finance, legal, marketing operations, many other areas and and really requires um kind of a social hat to be able to go out and talk with these other areas of the business in order to get things done. So I've had to build up a rapport with many different areas business and many different personnel to be able to complete my work. Um as the company is global with many headquarters, I've learned to balance workload accordingly and be able to connect with colleagues that live in different time zones from um America, southeast, asia, Latin, America and areas of europe and Africa and the Middle East. Um I've had managers that have lived in the UK in europe and also in America. So have been used to understanding how people operate from different time zones with having to manage a group of people. I've been afforded exposure to working with senior management personnel, including at the S VP level and at my previous job, chairman of a company, I've worked with several kinds of managers myself and learned practical methods firsthand and I've seen what does and doesn't work. I've seen managers that have been signed off with stress and had to leave the company and those who have also thrived. Um so to speak me personally, I'm very detail oriented and very hardworking and quite efficient in completing my duties to the best of my ability. Why I'm always available to help a colleague with any query and give them time and training to maximize their potential and given the same opportunities that have been afforded to me over the years. All right, an honest fair and sympathetic and and when managing a group of people in return for their hard work and dedication, if I feel that's what I'm getting from them and I know that I can trust them and they do their work, then I will afford my team members certain flexibilities to complete their duties. I think when to summarize why I should have the management position. I think the one challenge people find is that I'm quite young. I am 31 now. But at the same time I lead by example, so in terms of if we have to go into the office I will be there early. I'll be there late just to set the precedent that I wouldn't ask someone to do anything that I wouldn't do. But at the same time I understand now that the people working from home commuting and because of COVID-19 and other issues that I now understand, the flexibility and the benefits of working from home and what it can get out of team members. I think that with different devices now like Microsoft teams and zoom, we've been able to access staff so frequently now, mm hmm, that they're almost available when we need them. So I think that by introducing bit of more of a fluid approach in terms of time introducing core hours for a team where we either at least have to be together at certain points in the week or at least have to be locked on at certain points of the week. That I think by giving this to them, we will be able to get the best out of the team.

The first one is that I enjoy working and I like being a team member, like working together, accomplished tasks. I've done this for 30 years and I love to come to work next. I've managed people for 15 years. My main approach is that if they do well we do well and I do well, so I work to make their lives and their careers grow and I'm happiest when I hire someone, I enjoy hiring, I am released happy when I have to fire someone, but I work hard to mentor them and help them understand what their job entails and how they can successfully completed. Ah actually after hiring the next thing that makes me the happiest is seeing someone that I've worked with that's worked for me and under me to move on up in the company to get promotions to be successful and I've seen this happen to, I've seen people that I have initially hired that have ended up in positions higher than myself, which is very interesting, very satisfying. It's difficult for people to understand when they first come to a job exactly where they fit in and the culture of a company. That's one of the first things that I want to work with so that they feel part of the team and part of the company if you start this way, there are chances of success as an employee are a lot higher next. We talk about what they want to accomplish and what I need for them to accomplish. And we set out the smaller tasks building to larger tasks and finally to heads of committees, two small assistant and then supervisor positions as they work their way up. This is definitely very satisfying part of the job i in the same way and mentored by the managers, the department heads that are above me, I work with them. I explain what's going on in my department and I translate that information department's goals and the company goals down to the employees that work under me skin. This has been very successful. If they know where we're going and they know how they fit into the team. They will be a lot more successful and happy in their jobs. Happiness is important. Feeling that you are part of the group, part of the team is important. So communication, it's fine. People have to have not only goals in their jobs but goals in their lives and make sure that they take enough time off to be with their families to give a little bit of off time and when they didn't expect it to compliment them for a job. Well done. I work hard to get bonuses that might be bonuses that if they deserve it. I have no problem and going to bat for. I have worked as a manager Covering two libraries to small libraries at the same time and a large university department. Both different. But I was able to adjust and fit the mold that was needed to get that job done, Both jobs required working with people smaller groups, 15, larger groups. Yeah, I had to grow myself. I had to learn how to do this. It wasn't easy. I picked up books and read them. I asked fellow managers. I took courses and all of these pieces of the puzzle. Get together to where I. In the end I was a successful manager and I can be one for you and I will be heart of your team. I sincerely hope you hire.

Um um So we would have to make sure that we will be delivering kind of trolleys and creates full of items whether that would be kind of house where or christmas themes or toys and would be kind of filling the warehouse or taking items and stocking them, putting them in trolleys or putting them in crates to make sure that they would be fulfilled for the morning orders, I'd have to look after 10 or so people making sure that they would know what their task was for the night, making sure that communication between the shop floor and the shop for records and the warehouse were congruent with what with what worked together so that during the day shift there wouldn't be unnecessary calls being made down to the warehouse looking for. So and so item which hadn't been ready for a customer who had been looking to, who ordered it online or made a phone order, looking to collect at a certain time and they wasn't ready for them. Um I think in particular the leadership skills were important in terms of making sure that especially during the christmas period because we hired a lot of new temporary recruits who would be and hide for 3-month periods, some would say on, some wouldn't making sure that the people that have been working there for a long time over the few years or more would be open and receptive and helpful to the new recruits in terms of showing them around the warehouse, showing them how best to get around the warehouse, and also helping making sure that um, the health and safety procedures were followed and understood by everyone, that wasn't really an option because that was kind of part of the training, um, as part of kind of the uncles training before you would even even I would even be accepting the job, giving the job to offering the job to anybody, but health and safety in the warehouse was very important to um that was a very important factor that way. I tried to keep in Haditha, bear in mind for at least yeah, Nearly three occasions where there may have been, and and that, and then there was nearly an accident in the workplace which was prevented because people knew where certain items were, such as the ladder, which the latter was kind of used to get hard to reach items such as cushions or pillows or things like that, that were highly shelled, shelled up high, and that would be something that we'd have a whole set that whole kind of procedure on how to take out and put away again. Um But there was I think the leadership skills were important in terms of making sure that everyone was on the same page, no matter how much how long they'd worked there, everyone what got together but worked together well as a team and that if anyone had any questions that they were um answered and that they were looked into when if they don't have any concerns, they were looked into that everyone felt um they were apart of the of the family essentially.

Thank you so much for your consideration. Um For me in this leadership role, I really appreciate it and there are several reasons where I think I am equipped and ready for this role. Um The biggest reason is my background and experience. Um I have a lot of background leading a variety of different groups and I think that will make me best equipped to not only thrive in this role but help lead your company um and take it to the next level. Um I've experienced working with a variety of age groups um whether that was working at a summer camp where I was the lead counselor, helping design programs and keep things very interesting for young adults. Um So that has given me a great great background in designing engaging activities regardless of the age. I'm currently a teacher and I have every day have to design engaging lessons, plans to keep students not only excited but eager to learn. And so I think these skills will be critical in engaging the young adult population of our clientele and also using that to extrapolate towards the older clients to build really engaging marketing materials that will help lure them in to our services. Um I also have a variety of experience managing others um while working at um a foundation in Atlanta where I he served for two years. Um I managed a younger fellow while I was the senior fellow and in that role I have to guide them through the position and that really helped develop my managerial skills. Um So that will be critical in the leadership position at your company. I will be able to use these leadership skills that I developed managing the superior and um someone below me to help developed the staff because while you can build an extraordinary team, they need to find something rewarding in joining the experience at your company. And so by having me at your company, I will make sure to invest in their leadership and invest in their skills development because they want something out of the company, not just a paycheck, and I will ensure that they will be able to grow, arrive, build their own skills and one day become the future leaders of your company. So I think these are a lot of the critical experiences that will bring and finally, I think there are a few qualities that I have that will make me an instrumental leader in your organization. The first is listening ability. Every leader likes to talk, every leader likes to share their abilities, but not every leader likes to sit back, listen, listen to the company, listen to the feet on the ground and take those amazing ideas from those around you and implement them into your daily work. And that's one of the strongest aspects of who I am as a person, and I think that would make me an excellent fit within your company because I love to listen to the feet on the ground. I love to implement grassroots up ideas and implementation and I believe that these are the successes that will bring your company from a base level as a successful company to really one of the highest achieving companies in the field. So for all these reasons my experience characteristics, qualities as a person, I think I would be an excellent fit with your company and I think I would help elevate you from a quality company to a truly excellent company that dominates the field and reaches that next level that you're seeking.

So most recently I was doing teacher training, where I would be the teacher in front of a classroom of students. They I said, well, as a teacher is a leader in a way, and I would be leading by example, for a start. So things like being punctual and making sure that all of the resources are of a high quality to encourage the work from the students and making sure that any instructions I gave to the students were clear and the communication was as clear as possible, and also helping students if they needed it. Um and being able to find out whether the students need help or not, and having and ways of testing them, I suppose, and to make sure that they know what they're doing, um reassuring them as well, and and motivating them as well. Um okay, so before I did teach training, I worked at a college And I was a science technician for four years. So, um specifically physics and and there I had a second role as a Duke of Edinburgh Coordinator, so that was a leadership role as well, because I had to ensure that all the students were completing their their sections, that they had to do a physical activity, that's volunteer and that's a learner's skill, I had to make sure that they were completing those to a satisfactory level and then excuse me, um as well as that we went out on expeditions. Um so I would have a group of students with me and I would lead that group of students, These are college level of college age students, so 16-18, so we're a bit more responsible than the students I was teaching and, but yeah, I had to teach them skills out in the field, um, in that position. Um, then, so before that job I worked in a kitchen, I was a kitchen assistant and while I wasn't, I was more of a sous chef, kind of kitchen as a kitchen assistant in a cafe. So despite me not primarily being responsible, there were many times where I would be the sole person working in the kitchen. So then everything was my responsibility, all of the food that needed preparing. Um, and then if occasionally in that situation there was another trainee chef called paris who in, I would have to teach teacher and, and I suppose let her know how to work in the kitchen. So I was teaching her recipes and teaching her about cleaning the equipment safety and things like that as well as community, communicating with the waiting stuff. You were almost like the, the people between us and their customers and I suppose way, way before that, I used to coach lacrosse too young Children as well. So, um, so that's a leadership position where I had to come up with training routines and activities, make sure all the Children could hear and understand my instructions, um, as well, it has a lot of similarities to the, to the position in the classroom where you need the Children to look up to you and respect you, enough to listen to what you've got to say, take on board all of your ideas and things.

Um Currently I'm working behind the scenes, right behind the camera either as a first A. D. S. Or assistant director also I also split my time between helping to assist director and also helping the camera team so I'll be like a second day see so I'll be the guy on the Clapper board. Um and the reason why I'm going for this position for higher management position and and the production team um it's mainly because I have quite a few skills I believe in terms of leadership that I think will be beneficial for the team. Um And so coming from my vast experience um working as assistant director, obviously you have to have quite a clear projected voice, you know you have to be able to um sometimes be the bad guy, sometimes be that person that no one really likes. We kind of need that look this has to be done, we have you know, silence on set, that kind of stuff. Um But yourself to be quite clear in the way that you communicate because for example if you um start if your reaction to the actors and then you're not recording then well that's terrible. So you need to really have to have a systematic organized approach to the way in which I communicate and clarify to to my whole team because there's always gonna be times where I don't know the lighting isn't ready yet or the Gaff is still working on the set and I need to be aware of this so I need to be a little old times. So I believe in terms of leadership that can be quite beneficial, so I'll be quite alert and I'm actually quite good under pressure, especially under time constraints as you probably well aware and film sets. So I believe that would be quite uh advantageous that I'm very, quite clear and precise in my communication. I don't really waffle in terms of uh you know, could you maybe do like this or that? I'm like no, no, can you walk from here to here or after I give it 12 beats, then move after action. Very clear and concise communication, which I think is essential for leadership. Um I also think in terms of the field, specifically like I have a wide array of experience in helping people, um obviously teaching trainees how to assemble the camera, how to to get ready and what to do, especially on set, some quite good in terms of training people I believe as a leader really, it's it's more about developing other leaders in your team so they can they can work independently of you, so they can essentially be their own boss, their own leader and I think it can be quite good in that kind of capacity. Um I also think like I said from a point of, like I said, specifics obviously knowing the set, knowing the chain of command, you know, from director first, 82nd, 83rd, 80 and so on and knowing the whole capacity of the production team. Um I can be quite friendly and quite likable obviously as the first city, like I said, sometimes you have to be the bad guy, but I think it's very important after those situations that make it very clear that it's not a personal thing. It's just, I'm sorry, we just need to get it done, let's just do it not to do it in a way of that derives a sense of malice, but more of just, you know what we've got to get it done. As I said earlier, I think I'll be quite good at that. Um Yeah, I think in terms of, like I said like a managerial position, like I know the team is quite well. I'm very well organized. I have to take quite a lot of notes and I have to do so in quite a short space of time. So things will be very concise things have done quite well. Often I spend a bit of time, maybe like an hour or so of my own day, wherever it's during lunchtime, making sure everything's ready to go because there's a lot of responsibility on me to do so in that capacity. And so I feel that because of that already have the leadership experience for that as well. Um And like I said, I can, I can be quite likable, I can be quite a fun friendly person. I think I have the skills to help motivate people to to do their best. Sometimes days can be quite long since, since they can be 12-14 hour days and it's really difficult to keep the energy levels up to keep people moving and going and I think it can be quite good in that capacity. Um So thank you very much for listening to my audition. Um I really hope to hear back from you soon. I have plenty of questions for the role, obviously like, you know, pay for example, and also hours. Um and also what kind of, you know how I can best help in that kind of capacity.

I've been in leadership for over 10 years and have managed anywhere from one individual to a team of over a dozen. That includes all my, you know, prior management positions in the past.

Um it was very challenging at first, for the first few months, we really butted heads, but really with my sincere, you know, outlook and my, my empathy, I was really able to win her over and that was a very, very big moment in my, my entire career was really just one individual, but being able to change her life and really help her see that there's, you know, more of a bright side to look at than than a dark side and to really focus on the positive things in life, really could just have such a big impact, Not just on the, you know, the 8-5, but really from a, from a whole life standpoint, and really I was able to just help change her attitude and change your work style and really make her much more effective and efficient.

So I'd like to start by listing my previous work experience that is relevant to this post. I first managed a growing computer unit in a college of further and higher education From 1971 to 1985. The first decade of that time, computing equipment was relatively relatively dear, relatively expensive and difficult to obtain. So the child was very much about being inventive and frankly it is syncretic. No one knew how to do it then. So a regular stream of new ideas was vital, but it was also very important that staff didn't lose heart because they felt that they had inadequate resources to do a good job. So a great deal of my time was committed to maintaining their enthusiasm. I had had no management training at that time, having been an electronics engineer and computer scientist previously. So everything I did was based on my intuition and to be honest guesswork, but that meant I needed to have a clear sense of what others in the team thought and felt, and more or less wild process of osmosis. I developed a style that prioritized open communication, in which I encourage staff to express their ideas, both technical and social, without worrying about how silly they might appear. I tended to do that by expressing my own outlandish thoughts which gave them permission to do the same. The result was that our decisions, policies and processes were exactly that ours, not mine. And of course, that gave everyone a sense of ownership over them. There was therefore little subsequent argument about them, unless they needed to change in the light of new circumstances. If more often, when that happened, a new round of discussions would take place. The problem here from a management standpoint was the danger that nothing except discussions would ever take place. I avoided this in two ways. First, as soon as the problem appeared, that was not amenable to an immediate solution, I would create a small sub committee. It often more or less charges itself because there were usually two or three people who were especially interested in these issues with a short deadline to report back. Second, I would set a date for a unit meeting to discuss the results of each of the current subcommittees. That meeting would last 45 minutes and no more. Each issue would either be resolved or referred back for further consideration by the relevant subcommittee. This protocol proved sufficiently successful that I imported it into my next job as head of department with just over 100 staff spread across a wide range of scientific disciplines. When I left that post, I joined the institution of analysts and programmers as Executive Director for training and professionalism here. I was again acting in the leadership role, but those I was leading were much more disparate, both in location and expertise. This is a problem with all professional bodies. Their members are responsible first to their employees, not to their professional affiliations. Okay, so the nature of the links must perforce be quite loose, but members must be clear about what they have joined and the responsibilities they have taken on in doing so again. This is about keeping track of their concerns, both technical and social devising ways to monitor them and reacting to how they are developing.",POSITIVE,0.3362,0.0716,0.3196,0.2726,601.0,LOW,6,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),10.17,0,1,0,"Master's degree (e.g. MA, MS, MEd)",Male,8.941271,9.260863,9.927495

Mm hmm About 2005 I have a degree in computer science. I have also a degree in and master in business administration and I also have cybersecurity degree. I have been working for long and I always have the best ah this position to help out customers. I have been working with customers every time for every single job that I have had. So I'm very customer centric. I do believe that in order to provide value to customers, you need to be able to provide good support to them. And that usually means not saying to customers that's not my job or trying to not be helpful at all or trying to do whatever you can do to get the customer off your back. So for me that is not the way that you provide value to the customer. So sometimes even if it's out of my scope, if I know the answer or another solution to the customers issue then I can help them. If I'm not able to help the customer for any reasons then at the barre list. Um I tried to point them in the right direction, telling which team to reach or to provide a hint or or an X. Action plan that they can perform to try to find a solution. And if it's something that ah I can help them with. Um even if it's just ah too hard or really not something that we do, then I try my best to make sure that they received that they're getting the best support possible.

So when this happens you need to let the customer know that ah that you're still working on the case even though you don't have a solution just yet, that's that's so they know that ah your ah you haven't forgotten about that customer.

And even though we don't work in tall buildings with managers and all of those things, there's a lot of leadership involved in trying to yeah, to find sustainable work and a good culture like ours um in a lot of ways you have to have leadership because if you don't um the whole ship speak things, so to speak. Um coming from a history of working in organizations, I've picked up a lot of skills from my past supervisors and a lot of benefit to having a lot of great leadership examples to look to. And one of the hardest parts about being self employed, um being a self directed, self motivated kind of entrepreneur is that you have to create all of those things for yourself and you learn very quickly that in trying to convince people to come alongside you to partner with you to work with you, that if you don't have leadership skills, if you don't have passion, if you don't have excitement for what you're doing, um you can't expect anyone you're working with to have it either, which is hard in that no one is going to be more excited for what you're doing than you. So in a lot of ways you have to set the own bar for yourself, for your projects, for your work. Um and bring that to the table every time you're, you know, addressing a prospect of partnership. So for me, you know, some days, leaderships looks very different some days, um it looks like just being willing to get out of bed to put clothes on to to brush my teeth, but she was on to basically go about my business and do my work in my home, even though my home is a place that for most people, that's where you rest, that's where you relax, but um when you don't have a building, you go to that you walk into and the lights are already on and people are already doing work and there's an expected structure to that when you have to be the one to create that structure and present that structure and impose that structure upon yourself. It takes a great deal of leadership to lead yourself to be a worker. Um if that makes sense, I guess I like to tell people that um it's it's a double edged sword, a lot of people want to be their own boss, so to speak, but so few people I think want to boss themselves around. And so leadership often in our situation looks like having to lead the half of me that would rather just sleep in or stay in bed um into the chair and into a place where I say it's this is the time of day, it is that we said we're going to start work, we're going to start doing work. So yeah, it takes a lot of, I think, I guess self motivation to impose that upon yourself and to be willing to follow your own leadership in that way. And yeah, that's been a big learning curve. I think it's definitely not for everybody, but I think if you can't bring that to the table for yourself and your own projects, hey, what's up? Hey, I'm recording a thing really quick. Okay, I can take him if you want. Yeah, Yeah. Let me see him. Yeah, yeah, yeah, he hasn't burped, sounds good. Got him. Thank you so much, wow, that's cool. This is my son, he's like I said, when you work for mom, there's all sorts of interruptions, all sorts of curveballs. So what I was saying was you just have to have moments where you can carve out space for yourself too to be the leader that you need to be in order to get your own work done. He really hasn't worked yet. So for me and this time those moments are fewer and further between and I kind of this little guy who's two weeks old, so I'm trying to find the moments I can to get what I get, I get what I need to get done. But having this little cute one hand makes it a little harder when my business partner slash songwriting partner is nursing him most of the day. So communication gets a bit trickier and I Oh, I know, I know. I know. Anyway, all that to say I'm not qualified to be anybody's manager except my own because that's how our business works.

My name is Sandy Land laying yet. So and I believe I'm the perfect candidate for the manager position that you have. The reason why I believe so is because of the abilities and the leadership skills that I have. But not only that also my personality, I'll start with my personality. I'm a diplomatic person which means that I find the right words to say things to people in the right way and not offend them. However with that what I've learned is that I need to have a balance balance between being diplomatic and also being straightforward because sometimes when you are diplomatic most of the time people can tend to undermine your authority. So being straightforward and letting them know that there will be consequences if they do not pull their weight for an example or if they have discipline issues there will be consequences. It's a great thing because they know what kind of person you are. They know that you will not tolerate any kind of behavior that is outside of achieving organizational goals. Number 21 of the things that I'm good at that I'm very, very good at is working with people from different backgrounds with different personalities. That's the thing that I learned in an at an early age while I was a manager while I was in my first manager or post is that as a manager you do need to be able to understand people and be very tolerant and also be able to bring people together from different backgrounds with different personalities and make sure that you are all on the same page because if you are able to do that and you have that kind of ability, you will be able to achieve quite a lot in a short space of time. And then one of the things that I'm also good at is sparing people on and motivating them. However, with that, what I've learned is that you need to have a balance motivating people and sparing people on is a great thing, but making sure that you don't get to a point where you are overbearing is one of the things that I've learned, because it's great when people know that you trust them and you want them to work hard and you motivate them to do what needs to be done in order for the goals to be achieved. However, at the same time, making sure that they do not feel like you are always looking at them and seeing how they're doing things are keeping an eye on them all the time. It's good that you give them that freedom to be a little bit creative with whatever task that they have at hand, as long as they know that this is the goal that needs to be achieved and it has been communicated clearly. So I'm quite good with that and one of the things maybe I'm sure you've noticed is that I'm quite a good speaker, being a good speaker means that people will listen to you all the time because you are able to represent yourself in a clear manner and you are able to tell them exactly what needs to be done without showing any kind of not having any confidence, You are always confident all the time and with my good speaking comes charisma, charisma, makes people always trust me and they always have confidence in the advice that I have for them and whatever that I have to say about whichever situation they need assistance with. So my charisma and good public speaking ensures that I'm able to motivate people really well, organizational goals are always achieved when I'm around or whichever company that I get to always find myself in a leading position within no time, even if I do not start in that way, always happen to work my way up and see myself in a mini minimum managerial position, because of the skills that I possess, I cannot hide them, they just come naturally to me and everybody around me always notices that I deserve to be in a position like that because of who I am and what I bring to the table, it would be great to work with you guys so that you are able to see what I can do and what I'm able to bring to the table for yourselves, looking forward to meeting each and every person in the business and looking forward to meeting you guys as well and proving myself because I do believe that before you actually trust me, I need to prove myself and show you that I am capable of doing the work that needs to be done.

And I believe that I can bring my successes and experiences to this drop mm hmm. Um I have the ability to find my niche within a group and support everyone's efforts. Thank you. For example my last job involved a lot of team projects and I was always able to recognize my teammates skills. So I would basically sit down with my teammates and I would I would kind of give them this short interview to try and understand where the what the streets the strengths are and what their weaknesses are. So after interviewing them unable to delegate the tasks, these tasks can be delegated to fit each person's school and I know that disrupts involves a lot of teamwork and group projects. Uh And this is why I think it would be a great opportunity for me to showcase my skills uh as as far as the job is concerned. So I am also very self motivated. So that is a if I am required to learn a new valuable skill that will help ah kind of propel us forward as a team, then basically schedule the time to learn those necessary skills and simply just out of passion to learn these skills and kind of execute them in the workplace.

So I was able to demonstrate good use of resources and time management in my previous roles because I was able to kind of also be empathetic with my with my team members, right? Because I want to I want to see kind of understand where they're at the level that they're at, so that I'm not I'm not kind of going too fast or too slow. That makes sense. I want to know that we're all at the same levels that we can work together and we can execute and we can get the job done in the least amount of time possible. So time efficacy, it's very important. I do believe that I have what it takes to present my leadership skills for this job and I would be extremely grateful if you can consider my application.

I think it's leadership. Leadership is a difficult thing. That's something you get through. Experience. My idea of leadership is Mhm. Being able to walk the walk and talk the talk so you I can't ask anyone to do anything unless you're willing to do it yourself. And it helps if you've done it yourself too. Okay. So for example, I've worked security for a long time and in security sometimes there's call offs and you have to work a double normal shift is about eight hours. Mm hmm a double 16. Now that happens, it stinks you find out 10 minutes before your shift ends, you're staying for another eight hours. I've done it many times. Why? In Seattle there's laws where you can just call at any time. So you're using a sick day and your boss. Can I ask you why? So that means I did surprise doubles is what I call them not fun. Even worse. Surprise triples, believe it or not. Sometimes You work 24 hours. I didn't have very good protection. Like I got time and a half for overtime and other places should be pay upwards of triple, which is what I should have got. But whatever. Another thing of leadership, one thing I'd like to talk about is added value. What's that? Okay, well when I managed a team with security officers and in the security business, sometimes you're asked, well can security do this, can they take out the garbage? Can they move boxes, can they cover the front desk And none of that is security related. Nothing. But I have my people do it. Why added value insecurity? You don't make money, You can always save money and security is expensive. So when the bean counters decide to Mhm start cutting things and they get to the security line say okay well what does security do? Well they do this this this oh but if we cut them we're not going to be able to do this, they're going to lose that. Who's going to pick up doing this? Who's going to pick up doing that? Wow. They do a lot of things. Yeah. Is that the value to recap? Walk the walk, talk the talk. I have experience in something. Don't ask people to do what you weren't willing to do or have done before and added value. I think those are good leadership things, Be aware and be helpful to be there for your people and that is Yeah.",POSITIVE,0.4921,0.1202,0.3692,0.0185,423.0,LOW,6,99.0,2.0,Using only (2),19.45,0,1,0,"Bachelor's degree (e.g. BA, BS)",Male,8.370761,8.712086,8.568028

I have prior experience in leadership positions and I'm confident young professional in my field and I have previously covered as front of house manager for a large theater in Liverpool, which involved delegating staff responsibilities amongst the staff on the night, ensuring customer feedback relations with members of the public watching the shows are still a's on stage management, a range of issues there alongside administrative duties, including cash flow ins and outs, expensive expenditure and things like that. Um I have also, I'm now currently self employed on a freelance basis, so I work in leadership kind of positions with other clients, say it's a mastering engineer, so I am taking the lead and telling them what I think they what their projects would benefit from and things like that. I consider myself quite charismatic. I'm not the most charismatic person you'll ever meet, but I consider myself kind of, I've got personality, I think I'm friendly, I think I'm approachable and I think I'm good with people. I think my people skills are very strong. Um I've got good academic experience in the past. I've graduated master's degree distinction undergraduate first class honors, both in music with the life of specializing in the former masters degree, specializing in electroacoustic composition. Um Yeah, I think my leadership skills are very strong. I've previously worked in a lot of kind of in person settings that require a lot of collaboration and a lot of delegation of responsibility and things like that. I understand the kind of pressure and responsibility that goes alongside these positions. My previous role, one of them the salaries role I work in for hollyoaks in Liverpool and line pictures, doing the music supervision as part of the team there. So that involved a lot of in person work with directors and editors and cast members and other people in the music team alongside producers, legal compliance and script writers and things like that says. And it was very much a case of staking our point, making sure that we were understood from where we stood on that stand point. So if we had a song that wasn't able to be used, we had to make it clear that we can't use that song. So it did require kind of leadership skills to be quite firm, quite resolute, but also of course not to get attention there. Um yeah, I think I have a roll of that position, Sorry, that position was very good position for me. It gave me a lot of experience dealing with kind of interpersonal conflict and things. There was quite a lot of conflict in that workplace. It was a very, very high pressure environment, which I know is kind of a cliche answer, but it's true, it was very, very high pressure. There were a lot of tight deadlines where we've been working on episodes some days we're going out on television later that week, so it really was very full on, very intense, I think as a result of that, I did really kind of come through on the other side a lot stronger in terms of leadership and interpersonal skills because I was able to kind of negotiate these situations, these uncharted waters a little bit with trepidation essentially, you know, making sure that everyone was happy everyone was on side and we got the message across that we needed to get across other leadership settings. Again, I am currently freelancing at the moment, so I am working on a musician at the moment. A lot of my work is involved pinching myself of course and the work I've done. So that is quite a leadership position because I've got to know how to speak with people and again get my message across without being pushy without being kind of overbearing. So I think I'm quite good at that, I think I'm quite kind of persuasive, but not a manipulative way. I think I can kind of get what I want out of people. I don't mean that in a negative way, I don't mean that in an aggressive way, I simply mean that I think I've got a skill for and that kind of leadership again of delegating responsibilities and things like that. Um So yeah, overall, I think I'm a very good candidate, I think I'm highly qualified with a Master's degree with an undergraduate degree with distinction first class, I've got prior experience in leadership settings, managing front of house for a theater. I've also worked freelancing now with a range of kind of clients and things like that, which requires a lot of leadership and a lot of kind of I know what I'm doing and you need to kind of convey that knowledge to the people. And again, my time at holiday was kind of gave me really good interpersonal skills where I think I'm quite confident at talking to others and getting my message across without being overbearing.

So based on my previous experience, I've obviously been in a lot of customer facing roles, I've got a voice like butter and people respond well to a little bit of Australian child as well here. So what that essentially means is that I've used my charisma and my abilities to bring myself forward and to make sure that I am a proper leader and I will lead it to other people is that I am trying to inspire others to do the same. Obviously a lot of that is based on Blade in my personal story and being upfront about who I am and I'm about up front through the experiences and difficulties that I've experienced in the past as well. So through delegation, proper allocation of tasks and um suitable time that I've been able to sort of bring forward a very, very strong sense of self into what I do and a strong sense of self brings a strong sense of leadership to themselves as well. So this is what would essentially, maybe a very, very strong leader in any sort of management role as far as skills go, I'm no longer a young spring chicken, I'm 30 years old, about the right age to take on more responsibility and I'm at the right sort of point in my life to make sure that I am bringing forth groups of people together, whether that be, you know, through team collaboration, whether that be through, um just having superior knowledge on tasks and things that have been working in a variety of different situations to make sure that the, the, you know, the tasks and the and the things that need to be done that need to be signed off and completed are done in a responsible and safe manner. Not only do I worry about the bottom line, I also worry about the safety and the productivity and the well being of other people around me as well. Um this is evidenced by my um previous track record in, in positions similar to a management role, um where I've always sort of been the team leader and if people don't really see me as a team leader, they see me as the heart of the group of the organization that they're in, because at the end of the day, a leader needs to show by example, and I always have a very, very strong record of showing that any task I will be in the muck with their in them, whether that be working back late or going forward and finding out a way to problem solve, to Upsell to um to expedite a process to make sure that it's as seamless as possible for everyone. And this is why the evidence shows that I'm a ready a leader, I always have been a leader and I think if, you know, given the opportunity to go in and leadership or I'd be a suitable fit because at the end of the day, doesn't matter what, you know, it's how you've done it, how you've bounced back from those sort of situations and to make sure that you know what it's like to be in the trenches with your team and then if you, if they truly believe that you are a genuine person, they will follow you naturally. So I think that's why I would be a great great leader and I am hitting the four minute mark. So I believe that would probably be a suitable time for me to conclude this recording recording. Thank you very much for your time. I hope this is convincing enough. And you have a lovely day.

I'm currently a the manager in an IT team Um for a large telecommunications company, I've had 40 years experience Of which 30 years in the sector and 15 years leading the team. Um I feel that my own personal management style um First of all is very organized. I tend to be uh I tend to like to make sure that my team, you know what they're doing. I'd like to know what they're doing. We have regular 1-1 meeting so I can actually get an understanding of the problems that they've got and ways that I can help them fulfill their their particular role. Um Also, these 1-1 meetings are very useful to me because I can actually understand if there there's a particular blockers or if they're falling, they're failing to perform their particular task in a certain way. Um I'd personally like to keep my finger on the pulse of what's going on within the entire team. And it's it's quite important to me that I do that. Otherwise I feel out of the loop, I try to be empathetic to my team. So if they're facing problems at all, they would hoping that they would come to me and generally they do and I've solved quite a few problems with people or help them with personal issues even and blockers for getting through to work. I'd like them to feel that they can trust me. I tried to trust them and I give them a lot of free of a lot a lot of leverage and a lot of that they can decide issues for themselves. I'm not completely overbearing, but they know that if they've got a problem, they can come to me and I've got their back, that's very important to me because I do remember that when I was on a particular T team, someone didn't have my back and to be felt to feel that you've not got that, that back in, it's quite, it's quite bad thing really to actually have that someone and I feel that they actually do trust me and they treat me as a friend as well, which is important to me, um occasionally have to crack the whip when people aren't performing properly. But in general, I find with this approach, I don't often have to do it because people want to perform for me. Well I believe that anyway, and it seems to be that that's the case. Um I also try to um make connections with the whole team with team building exercises outside the particular job role that we're doing. So we will try to do a bowling night or night down the pub or something like that. So this way people can create relationships with them, their own team quite often with in my company, particularly people are geographically quite diverse in where they're situated. So if we can all meet, say in a central place in a large city, then we can all have a drink together or go and do something like car racing or something like that and I find that people will make those relationships and quite often people have got solutions to other people's problems. I've got all the solutions, so we try to be each one teach one within the team, so which is, which is very good. Um, I'm, I'm expecting, I'm hoping that this continues and this is the way I'm always open to new ideas and things like that. So hopefully people will come to me and give me new ideas and things like that. Anyway, I think that's time up for my video. I'm hoping that helps you hope it hasn't been too garbled.

Firstly I'd like to start off with some of my qualifications to give you a bit of a background Around myself. Um so I graduated in 2017 with my bachelor's in communication, which I then used to complete a bachelor's in tourism and travel two years later um As such, to give you a bit of background into my previous roles, I was in charge of a small team at a flight center company and as part of my duties, it was my responsibility to allocate my team to different roles during the day. As part of that leadership, I would talk with my colleagues and get a feel for what areas they felt they were strongest in. So for example, reservations, crew specialty etcetera um in tandem, I would then use those talks with my colleagues and organized training days around areas that they felt that they could improve on. Um Not only that I would organize training days around new products such as a new operating system, we were integrating into the company um In particular, I believe it was a reservation system and a client database. So in order to get my team up to date with the technology, I allocated time throughout the week to have a group session together, but we could kind of go over the basic functions um and work through things together. But then after that um I would organize one on ones with my colleagues and answer any questions that they felt weren't answered within that group session. So that being said. Um I believe the leadership skills that were most paramount in this role was the ability to be personable. Um Your workers are always going to work better in an environment where they feel they can approach approach you and talk to you regarding any issues that they may have in tandem by creating this environment. You're also getting your workers to work harder because they simply enjoy coming in. Um I truly believe that the work environment needs to be stable and it needs to be a good time for everybody if you don't have that and I believe you're failing as a leader. Um it really boils down to respect the respect you give and the respect you receive. So after this job I then worked as a manager in a duty free store at Sydney International Airport and I learned a lot of valuable skills from this job. Firstly this was a much bigger team and therefore I had to learn to adapt to organizing and liaising with more than just my colleagues, but also vendors and upper management in the company. So as part of this role I took a few leadership courses that were offered to me and have gained a valuable new skill set that I've taken, not just not just into work but into everyday life. Um As the airport is a grounds for a busy environment and oftentimes stressful environment, I was taught skills to deescalate, deescalate potential volatile situations, which came in handy after a particular rowdy customer caused a commotion in the center of the store. Um, Using the skill sets that I had gained, I spoke calmly with the customer, found out the problem and then worked out a solution together to try and have the best outcome, not just the customer, but also for us at the company. Another example of the skills I learned was how to deal with employees who didn't get on together and how to manage both their expectations in the workforce for what they wanted out of the job, acted as a mediator between the two employees and found workable solutions that would allow the company and the team to run as effectively as possible. All in all I believe would be a good fit for this position because I believe I have the demonstrated acumen in this area in similar roles and if given the opportunity could apply the skill set, I have to further benefit the company.

Um I have a wide variety of skills within management, I've been a manager myself way over 25 years. um I have managed large and small teams, I think probably one of the most important things about management is the ability to be able to listen and take advice. The manager doesn't have to be able to do everything that his team does, and in fact some of the best managers I think are forced to rely on the fact that they can't do what their teams do. Um and actually it makes their teams feel more valuable. So I've been in positions where I've managed teams where I could do all of their jobs and actually it's made them feel less empowered I think, and as a result I think I've quite got the same out of them. People take pride in specialist and I think that's quite important. I'd like to bring that out, I'd like to manage with a bit of a sense of humor, I know that probably isn't necessarily coming across in the presentation, but um at the end of the day, no one turns up to what to do about job. Most people turn up to actually try the artist and do what they can um and have a sense of fulfillment at the end of the day. So I think that's quite important and one of the ways to engender that in people is with humor and with compassion, the two things tend to go hand in hand when they don't, creates a very sensitive environment. Mhm. But compassion, I think listening, understanding the issues working with people and being part of a team previous in paris you know its first among equals. And I think that's the trick to being a worthwhile valuable manager is your ability to be able to bring that across when you're managing your team. I think the other thing is attention to several facets to this, but attention to detail. So it's noticing the little things you can work with people for years in the same office, in the same meetings, in the same M. S. Teams meetings. But you can know very little about them because you the relationship that you have doesn't engender that if you sit back and you actually ask questions about people, you find out a little bit more about the person that you're dealing with, that you're managing the people within your team, their personal life to a certain extent their background, what are their interests, Wednesday, kids birthday, you know, how many dogs have they got? Bring that up. People remember that you remembered? Um It tends to bring teams together. I think the other thing, particularly post pandemic was quite important is actually bringing people together something that we've lost. Something that we've spent most of our time sitting in front of screens like this um dealing with dealing with our teams. Um I don't think it does give the same results. I don't think it gives the same sense of community. I don't think it gives the same sense of purpose. I don't think it enables problem resolving in the same way difficulty is, it's it does several things for people and I don't think it's helpful for a management perspective and blurs home and work life, which for some people works well if some people really doesn't work well at all, um it also doesn't enable the same support structures, so you can sit back and you can talk to a member of your team and say hi, how you doing, how are you feeling today? Um you notice signals with people if things are not going well and you don't necessarily notice those signals remotely. It's very difficult to pick those up and I think that's of critical importance when you are, I'm looking at leading a team. The other thing I think is quite critical is that managing a team, leading a team of two different things, um you can be a very good leader, but not a manager, you can be a very good manager, another leader. The best of both. A leader without manager tends to um lose focus, um lose things around the edges. A manager without a leader can be quite compassionate list can be quite distant, can be quite functional I suppose.

It. Our a team working within the IT industry, we're a team that have to deal with lots of internal and external customers. So having great communication skills is very, very important. Being able to speak to people at the top level of companies, directors or board members down to people on the lower end of the company, it takes different types of communication. So I've developed those skills over the years, I'm very good at problem solving again, relating to the IT background, it involves a lot of problem solving when problems come in and and need to be solved in a quick and timely manner, which again, links in again, which links in to meeting deadlines and time management. Time management is a very important in leadership, especially if you're responsible for coordinating a team of people found and developed skills that are very good at doing that over the years, we have people from different backgrounds and different walks of life that that work with us and for us and we have to learn how to get those people on our side to get the best out of them, which is a key responsibility for a good leader delegation is also very important skill that I have developed strongly over the years with increasingly varied work skill sets in teams that have worked in, it's important to know who enjoys doing what and who knows the most about certain topics and whatever. So being able to push those tasks to those people, give those tasks to those people is a very useful skill to have. Um If people enjoy what they're doing, you'll get uh huh results and giving and receiving feedback is another important skill set I think for leadership that I can demonstrate highly um without feedback we don't improve. So it's important to get good constructive feedback and give good constructive feedback to the people that you are leading. Managing people is a big big one as well. I suppose that's one of the biggest ones along with communication, managing people and the people that you are leading in a team or even if there's only two of you, if you're managing one of the person, managing them, getting the best out of them, meeting their expectations as a leader and then helping them to perform to the best of their abilities. Um What else do we have time management of touched on that briefly, but again, ties in with the organization's organization and time management are vital. Time management. Probably being one of the most vital skills for any job. Whether that's leadership or not being able to meet deadlines and set realistic deadlines is something that everyone should be able to do, let alone just let alone leaders. And then teamwork and motivation is a big, it's quite a big, very big, all encompassing skill set. A group of skills staying motivated and what you're doing and being able to motivate the people that you are leading is really important. As I said before, keeping those people on your side helps get the best out of them and being able to keep people happy and what they're doing by giving them tasks that they enjoy doing, giving them the feedback when they do them well or giving them the feedback when they need to do something a little bit better is really important. So I think a good overall rounded skill set makes a good leader and finally, to lead by example is one of the greatest ones not being afraid to get stuck in when it needs it and get the hard work done for the good of the team.",POSITIVE,0.864,0.0017,0.1289,0.0055,652.0,HIGH,11,98.0,1.0,Using only (2),9.959999,0,1,0,"Associate degree (e.g. AA, AS)",Male,8.237831,8.567565,8.226729

I want to start off by saying thank you for allowing me this interview for manager position. And to your question as what qualification of skills do I have for leadership positions. I'd like to start off by saying I have a very strong sense of communication. So I believe a leader should be very easily approachable and understandable. Mm hmm. Very coherent. So I believe that I'm very outgoing and reach out reaching. So I'd like to get my point across. I like people to understand what I'm saying. And also to it, hear what other people are saying. And then comfortable consensus. Another strong point I'd say as a leadership should hold would be having vision. So I believe as a leader, once you always look for the towards the future, I don't know to always improve the present for the future to bring it up. So I believe I'm very I'm a very strong visionary. I like to look for the best I like to drive to the best I'd like to cut off with whatever dragging us back so we can push forward and make the most. And also to get you off. I like to say I have a very strong sense of strategic and critical thinking when it comes to analyzing the situation and driving out and looking at the best of the best possible outcome. I believe I have a very strong sense of guide towards that and I believe that my only critical thinking but also analyzing and assessing what is that's necessary. So I got that let's continue on further. Very open minded and creative. So I like to, like I was saying before communication, like to hear other people's point of view and where they come from. I'd like to also take what is handed and innovate. So try to make more from what we just had innovation and critical and creative thinking and furthermore very responsible. I'd like to I like to take ownership of what I do and also take ownership of what the team does as well because there's no I in team, I believe that as a team, I would like a body though, we may have different roles in sections. We all work together the greater of the home and to continue further. I believe I'm very self aware and honest. I believe integrity's are strong point to have as a manager and leader of a leadership position. I believe that one should be very honest. So he may be reachable and approachable. Someone you can rely on to go to when things are not always the best where you want. It's cleaning further. I'm an active listener, always learning. I'm forever growing. So I believe I was a leader. You were burden to hold an image. I believe that as a manager you put out a pedestal and people are co workers and people other employees look at you for um not inspiration but guidelines like a month an example. So as a manager, I believe that would be perfect suited for that position and I believe I'm very confident in my demeanor, so I'm not a pushover just as a manager should. I believe the managers should always have this float down and needed, not the easily swayed from situations or people. I believe managers should be very, very thoughtful and very quick. Where did to understand the situation better and to finish off? I like to say I have a strong sex coaching skills, so I like to beat people. I like to guide people. I'd like to show them how it's done.

So let me start by saying that I am influenced by a few famous names that you may have heard of, such as Gandhi or Mandela or martin Luther King. The list of leaders, particularly those who are inspiring, motivational and great are pretty much endless, but what was so common and what was common amongst these fantastic people, what made them so famous and remarkable was that they had particular qualities which guided people, enabled people to build respect for them and also to follow them. And for me, a leader is one who not only knows the path, but also shows the path and walks on the path too often you see individuals who are in charge of the team or an organization, but don't necessarily their managers, they're not particularly leaders and for me, I like to try to ensure that I get my hands involved with what other people around me are doing, I feel that I am not, they're too boss, but I'm also, they're there to guide, I'm there too enable individuals to utilize their skills to their best potential. I don't use force to, you know, push people to follow me. I try to ensure that I respect their qualities and respect their skills as well as their interpersonal attributes and use this to not only my advantage, but also their advantage. I feel that it's important that the leader has a strong personality, so charisma, confidence engaging, although these are typical traits that can also be applied to a manager, I feel that with leader, they enable people to have a vision as well. So using these skills alongside a vision and a particular aim in order to help not only myself achieve things but also to encourage and engage others around me to also fulfill such aims, such ah overcome enough challenges and the hurdles, I feel that being leader for me, it's about having a positive and impactful communication with those around me, it's about managing with a visibility but not with power. So I feel that it's linked to having a particular style of commitment, determination, teamwork, loyalty and also above all earning respect and I feel that in my experience I've earned respect by providing and given respect to others. Leadership is about listening and I feel I believe that I have decent listening skills and attributes, I try to ensure that I take on board what other individuals say, if I'm in a t team have or if they would like to work in a particular skill set, I would help them to try to develop this leaders such as Mandela martin Luther king et cetera, these are great humans. I don't proposed that I am such an inspiring figure as such as these people, but I do use some of the qualities that they have in order to help engage the people that I'm around, I think about others more than I think about myself and particularly I try to encourage and cultivate environments where not only I can also grow as a person and grow as a leader, but also those around me are able to enhance upon their own skills, enhance upon their own abilities and develop practical practicalities in order to grow as individuals themselves. So yes, I feel that being a leader is very important and it is completely different to a manager, and I would say that I would like to be more of a leader in life than a manager.

I've studied leadership. I have an M. B. A. I've spent quite a bit of time researching, reading, attending seminars and so on and so forth. Of just understanding the leadership role, understanding leadership beyond that I really am a firm believer in stewardship and Stewart leadership. I think the best role that you can have as a leader is to support those that you're leading uh by allowing those people to grow to challenge themselves to find their purpose. And the way you do that is as a leader you select tasks in a job setting, you select task, you select roles and you support, right? So you allow those people two perform new tasks, learn new things, try new things and you support that and you must absolutely must communicate. I think as a leader communication is key where I excel in that is I'll sit down and I'll talk with my employees. I'll sit and I'll talk with uh my direct reports and find out how they feel. Um empathy is huge when you're leading. You have to delve deep, you can't have everything be superficial and and top level you really need to get down there and and talk with your employees and really get an understanding how they're feeling what they're struggling with what is working what isn't working and then go from there and provide that. That nudge. You've got to get in there. You know one of the things with with leading is getting in there and hearing that feedback. So listening to that feedback, prying it out of the person if you have to, but getting that feedback being open to that feedback and also being receptive to win that feedback maybe isn't uh what you thought it would be or what you desire. I think that one of the keys to good leadership is adapting and change, and one of the best ways to do that is to solicit feedback from your employees. I think, you know, in terms of a review, we're used to the relationship where the leader or the manager reviews the employees, but there's no give and take, that's all the manager telling the employee what they've done or haven't done well what they need to improve on and so on and so forth. But we never get anything back. I think as a leader, you need to solicit feedback from your direct reports and have them be honest with you and be willing to accept criticism and be willing to accept feedback that may not please you and then make changes accordingly. I think the biggest struggle that most people have is that they one they don't want to get that feedback. They don't want that feedback and they don't solicit it until when they get it, they don't know what to do with it and you really have to do. You really, really have to do that and that and that can be beyond just uh feedback, you know, day to day. you can also get feedback from the person of what's working for them, what isn't working for them. When I talked about adapting uh that's a key, right? You talk to your employee and you find out what's working for them in terms of your leadership style, in terms of your expectations, so and forth, so forth. In terms of communication, you may have some people that respond really well to in person face to face communication. There may be others that prefer a phone call or a zoom meeting email, right? Uh you also have to set expectations and that can be done through that communication channel, right? Uh let that person know what they want, let them know what their role is and let them know what you want from them. Don't leave it ambiguous. Don't have an employee are struggling to figure out what they should be doing, who they should be speaking with. Um you know how they're doing, give that feedback, right? The feedback channel is huge, right? Always, always, always give feedback. And even in small settings and it doesn't always have to be positive when it's negative, ideally it's not it's not totally negative, but you get you offer improvement suggestions, right? So if something is wrong, don't beat up on the person, tell them why it didn't work and then tell them what they need to do to fix it and explain that and be they can be clear that and give benchmarks and go back right. And when assuming improvement happens, praise that improvement. If it doesn't happen, continue that communication channel, keep that communication channel open and continue to provide that feedback and say this is what needs to change. Take that time. Don't just assume that it will fix itself or don't just assume that the problem will fix itself or that they'll take that one suggestion of change and run with it. Make sure give them it in piecemeal if you have to. But but that's uh those are my suggestions for quality leadership and leading a group of people.

I suppose the best way for me to do that is to explain some of the skills that I bring to a team and some of the skills that I also require when I'm managing a team. So for the scenario, I suppose, no matter what process we're going through our job, we're going to be required to fulfill today. One of the main things that I'll do initially is seek as much information as possible from some of the team that I'll be working with. Find that it's important that the people and personnel that I have on the team, our knowledgeable, especially if there's some aspects of the job that I'm not aware of. Um So it's important that whatever the requirements are to make sure that the job is completed properly and that everybody that's sitting at the table has something to draw to that table. So I'll always look to have the best knowledgeable personnel available to me once I have all that information provided and I know that I have the right personnel, I'm then going to set down the goals are required to complete the job to a satisfactory result. I suppose that's true, appropriate planning and time management, setting out a schedule of the jobs, the processes that are going to be required to make sure that it can be completed. There's no point in rushing. Don't agree with that. I think it's important that it's done properly and to um to the best possible outcome. If we rush, we make mistakes and therefore mistakes means that the process itself won't be completed correctly from there, then I suppose it's important as the manager to be able to make the right decisions if we do come across problems that they're highlighted appropriately. So again, communication is very important there. It's important that if we come across issues or mistakes that we have made, which hopefully will be able to avoid true proper planning initially. But if we do come across mistakes that the team that we're working with, our happy, you know, to put their hand up or explain the mistakes that we've made and how how can we fix that? How can we get back to a point where the process that we're going through and the end goal is still achievable that we haven't gone to a point where it's a point of no return and we've lost out on that. So I suppose through that communication, both in writing and verbally, it's also important that we get to the point then of problem solving. So once we find the problem again, it's about using all the resources available and all the information and knowledge that we have to fix the problem. If we do come across one again, hopefully that wouldn't be the case. But in life mistakes are made and hopefully kept to a minimum. But once we do come across them, we can solve them. And I think that's important thing when it comes to a leadership characteristic that I have in myself, I feel that I'm approachable, um feel that people can give their points of view and you know, anything that's deemed appropriate will be listened to. Even things that we don't or that we find that aren't suitable at the time, it's still important because the last thing you want to do is if someone does come up with a suggestion or an idea that's not suitable to the process or task that we're doing at the time, if you're condescending or you know, dismissive of their points while in that scenario it may not have been suitable when you come to the next process or the next issues. You don't want that person to feel like they're they can't give their input or suggestions to you. So I think that from a leadership point of view through good communication, I'm always available for people to give their point of views, which can can be very helpful. Again, communication works both ways. It's important to be a good listener and make sure that the information you're getting in is um is taken on board and sometimes suggestions can come from all different places and all different people. So it can be very surprising as to the information that you get in. So that's why communication and listening is very important from, you know, managers point of view. Um and I suppose decision making, then as a manager, you need to be able to stand over your goals, even when you do have a team around you, when you are the manager, you have to be satisfied with the decision that you're making.",NEUTRAL,0.1021,0.0086,0.8873,0.002,817.0,HIGH,16,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),14.45,0,1,0,"Bachelor's degree (e.g. BA, BS)",Male,8.882881,9.200847,9.322302

Thank you for considering me for this leadership position. Um This management position, I think I have a lot of leadership abilities and skills that would be very useful in this position. I think I've proved in the last few years, um how my abilities have grown and been useful. Um and how I could step into this space and be a benefit to the organization. Um First off I'd like to say, I really do believe I am a people person. I think I've proven my ability over the last few years working with a number of volunteers and a number of other staff um that I work well with people that I'm usually put in a position of authority to oversee the work of other people. Um and then I think some of my gift ing's are in equipping and empowering other people in training and teaching. Um I have what I would consider a critical eye. Excuse me for my my allergies here. As I'm wiping my eye, I have what I would consider a critical eye and a critical voice and I don't mean that to say critical in the sense of negative, but in the sense of I frequently am looking for how we can improve things, how we can make things better. I would say that is one of my biggest gifts. Um I think that I'm very good at and I think that I really enjoy doing honestly, I have a heart to want to improve things and make things better. Um, so as I work with people, I am, I find it really encouraging to me to to help work with people and see how can I help you do your job better, How can I help you improve what you're doing to have a greater impact in your work? Um So that's something I really enjoy doing and I think that I can listen well in those spaces to, I've given you up or I've been given the opportunity to take some training courses over the past few years, including a counseling course that's given me new skills to be able to listen and make people feel heard and to just um interact with a lot of different kinds of people with different personalities, different backgrounds. Um so that I can so that I can interact with with people that are different than me and people that are different than each other and give each person what they need. And I think that's something I've learned in management too, is um I think I can drift towards a certain management style that I believe is effective, but I think any good manager knows that one specific management style is not necessarily helpful for everyone all the time that you do have to change and adapt your management style to fit the individual needs of each person you're working with. And so I believe that I can do that, that I'm able to do that, that I've shown um that I have done that, that when I work in a team of people, I can meet with each individual person and say what do you need in this moment, how can I best serve you here uh and then move on to the next person and continue to do that for each individual person and speaking of serving to it, I think that in regards to my leadership style and that kind of critical eye, critical voice that I mentioned before, I also want to be a servant leader, I think that's important um in management and I think it's another skill that I possess, that I have this ability to make people feel like I'm on their team, that I am not just a boss, an authoritative figure, looking down, looking over employees, but I'm in it with them, I care about people. Um and I I want to make you feel like I'm on your team and that there will even be, will even be times where I want to make myself less uh and serve you to help lift you up and and I believe that as a manager is really important because it makes people feel like they have someone backing them, when people feel supported, like someone believes in them and someone's on their team, I believe that they produce the best results uh and do their most effective, most efficient work. Ah And so yeah, to sum up, I think my gifting is my my biggest leadership abilities would be in um making people feel heard and listened to while continually having kind of a call to action to push forward to improve, to make things better. Um and just being able to adapt to the individual needs of each person that I interact with on the team. So uh I think that would be beneficial. I hope you could see it that way as well.

So involves being able to establish um small and large objectives that relates to the larger good organization. Like making the organization more without effective planning of wrong is a question of projects and you don't, if you don't have said schools based on resources and assign tax, you have project failures for the next one is communication. So for communication, communication skills are very important because if you don't communicate properly. Project teams or teams that you're working with, they tend to misunderstand and half 44 months, y'all needs to be for months effectively for matters or any of those used to determine the mood. The best mode of complications for specific messages. Um and sending emails having seems to be a team and the rest of that. So next one is assigning tasks to different members. Um It's many assign tax orders including tax here as a leader, you need to help completing the delegates enough tax to your team's. You select the best team member for the attacks and providing require instructions. These team members feel more um focused. They feel they have like a certain goal and the services in taxi properly because you're not just working with us unclear instructions. So it's very good to give clear instructions to your teams and dependability is able to depend and rely on you and equality like standards of behavior. Work ethics punctuality should be a good example to to your teams should be a good leader should be a good leader, right? Because if you know good leaders it seems will take you seriously. So integrity. Um being honest. Yeah and being honest is one of the good things about being a leader. Be true to your teams, don't lie to them. See as he's taking to your morals regardless of peer pressure under you don't be aggressive to them. Then to understand your leaders are leading by example encourage your team members to also hold themselves accountable for goals, actions, mistakes, troubles, problems in the office environment, um motivation to be able to motivate your team. I was beating the team and it's very important to finishing works and reaching objectives. Leading by example performance improvement, performance, Conflict management, you should be able to manage conflict and organization. It's the end to happen all the time. You have conflict every single time between things because it is not 100%. Um seems like you don't have arguments, problems, you should be able to resolve this conflict. So as to prevent projects being not being completed on time, we should be able to build your team um right techniques to use ability skills that they would use improving their strengths and allowing their weaknesses of power there jess strengths. So like the same building also involves being able to promote collaboration, supports them. With training and certification, they need to become better professionals in here. Specifically. It's cute. And then the last one it would be being able to decide. Make decisions, regulated decisions. Leaders with effective decisiveness were able to clearly understand the options and consequences for any decision that republicans will be able to make a good, clear decision and be able to decide well. So with this good with all these leadership skills, I think I'm able to Handle 18 and lead them to be a leader.

In the last year I have received numerous recognitions, both formal and informal, the CtN I award um and um I've had frequent positive feedback from clients and customers that they feel welcome and engaged in working with me and I feel that I can also develop those skills within the group setting for the people that I will be managing. I understand the challenges that come with the job and I feel prepared to help the team navigate them. I feel confident that I can improve overall employee morale and boost revenue for the organization. In addition to the accolades and recognition that I've gotten in my current role, I've received several awards for outstanding quality in education and of presentations for invention and presentations on technology. So there were awards for presentations on technology and that's a big part of what our organization does in that we try to train innovators two use resources in in an efficient way in order to try to accelerate innovation and improve our bottom line and help develop organic growth within the organization. Um I think my previous experience will also assist and aid our group in the opportunities that I have as far as providing networking opportunities. I know a number of the leaders and leadership within the organization and I would be very willing to mentor and assist the direct reports that I would have in improving their network within the organization as well. Um, aside from the development opportunities that I think I would be able to provide to the direct reports in the role. Um, I also, I think that my analytical skills would provide good background and good foundation for, you know, providing reporting through the vertical units within the structure of the organization and being able to enter reporting compliance. I am certain that in addition to my analytical background and my educational background, having had completed my Masters and phds that, wow, I have also learned how to learn. So I'm no stranger to development within the role and I'm very open to the possibilities of ah any classes or improvements in managerial responsibilities that would be made available to me if I were to be given the opportunity to take on this role.

I hope to be able to convince you with the best candidate for the role of course. But let me start by explaining what I've been doing for the past 30 years or so. When I started work as an accountant trainee I very quickly got to the position where I was able to lead small teams. So I learned very much on the job how to manage how to lead staff from a relatively early age and in some cases I was managing people who were older than me That might not not seem such a big deal when you're in your 40s or 50s, but when you're in your early twenties that is kind of tough. What I learned from that is that actually you've got to understand the motivations of those people, you got to understand what makes them tick and then be able to play those side things, make sure better lines with the corporate objectives and make sure that you're all then for trying to put in the same direction. Um I think one of the main thing I've learned over the years is the need to have an adaptable management style, one size certainly doesn't fit or and whilst you have to be careful when you're being adaptable or adaptive that you don't come over as inconsistent, it's important to recognize that different people respond to different types of management prompt management interventions and what I tend to find is particularly I take on a new team that there will be people who I can very quickly get to know well and get to trust and see their abilities are very clear by what they deliver and intentionally those people on a much longer lead, so to speak. Once I've got that position with them where there are other people, the kind of people you need to have some interventions with potentially, and I'd like to keep them in a much shorter lead. So at any given time, if you think of me as a dog walker, I've got dogs right out on long leads who I can trust and they're not going to run off and I've got more problematic dogs, shall we say? They're closer to me now, I do appreciate that employees, staff valued colleagues are not dogs, but I hope you understand the limitations of that analogy. So adaptability is really important, I think as well as getting to know your staff, so it's very difficult to work with people where you don't understand how they operate, what their views are and that brings me onto values. So I think it's important that a leader leads through their own set of values. No, ideally that should be the value set of the employer. Some employers state those explicit the others don't, but in any case, I think there's about the level of consistency that goes with the adaptability I mentioned earlier, it's important to have a degree of um don't know clinging to your values, not at all costs, but certainly having certain core being of yourself, that means that you will be driven by and understand those values if you come across a difficult situation, we do. You have a kind of reference point to go back to. So an example might be in a disciplinary case when you're trying to decide on the appropriate sanction for somebody. This is an extreme case. Of course, most of most management interventions don't end up in a formal disciplinary process, but sometimes there's a lot of subjectivity around how you sanction somebody in those situations. And I find going back to my core values and understanding what this person was trying to do, what the intervention, what the sanction will do and how that will motivate them is really, really important. So that's the bad side of it. But I like to motivate largely by working closely with my teams, but recognizing those professionals for what they are, so they're professionals, they're in a place to do a job. They generally do a really good job, They need some coaching, they need some guidance from the sidelines. They don't meet me all over there, work. I tend to work with very senior professionals who know exactly what they're doing and know that better than I do my job is to guide them, to make sure they're working together and to make sure that they're pulling in the same direction for the organization as a whole. So I hope you understood all of that. And I think I would leave you with the idea that things go wrong from time to time and when they do. I think it's important to be hard on the facts and soft on the person, so very much focused on what went wrong rather than.",POSITIVE,0.8121,0.0112,0.1206,0.0561,824.0,HIGH,11,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),17.8,0,1,0,"Master's degree (e.g. MA, MS, MEd)",Male,9.25558,9.570415,9.487888

Um I've actually been for the last two years, an elementary school teacher which requires quite a bit of leadership considering not only leading a class of 23 people, but Children at that between the ages of 6-12 roughly. Um I as an elementary art teacher had the unique ability to completely coordinate um the entire department within two different elementary schools, I was also able to lead and teach the department from an online perspective, during the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic. So I've gained online teaching skills as well as in person teaching skills in several different environments. Um And those teaching skills I think translate really fantastically to leadership skills because we study um specifically communication skills and communication skills I think are the essential quality of leadership. If you're not able to communicate with the people that you are supposed to be leading, then you are not going to be able to lead them effectively to perform whatever task or improve their abilities in any specific field. Um So from that experience I've learned that I'm particularly good at resolving conflicts with a balanced and fair approach. Um Prior to learning these leadership skills through teaching, I also managed retail into separate positions um when I was a college student And so I was able to manage a store with up to, I would say 10 employees working at a time as the key holder or shift manager there and that required a lot of directing. Um a lot of making sure that everything was happening around the story, the way it should be happening and doing that all while of course, still being personable listening to concerns, um filing concerns where they're supposed to go so that the team could work effectively as planned. Um So in that respect I think I have a lot of leadership skills capabilities and even when put in new positions like when I started teaching, it was fresh out of college and I did not actually major in um elementary education, I majored in fiber arts, so I was in field as an art teacher. However, I learned a lot while teaching my first couple of Years there and because of the COVID-19 pandemic, I think that a lot of us have to sharpen our skills very quickly without any choice and I think I did a very good job getting up to that challenge of really sharpening my skills, becoming a fantastic leader coach, teacher and mentor to a variety of different people, not only the Children that I taught, but my coworkers as well as those that I was able to interact with independently of work. So that is what I would basically say my leadership skills are um to recap being able to resolve conflicts with a fair and balanced approach, being able to maintain and monitor Different things happening within a space. Um even in the chaos of 20 plus Children running around. So I think that would be a big skill right there. Um I also currently work in a client based industry that is interior decorating um as a part time business that I've begun and that is definitely been trying my leadership skills because I am learning so much about how to um find different resources that are imperative to creating the next steps of my process, so being able to find those venues and those avenues and where to actually seek and to actually distribute different results has been a learning process and curve that I think I'm handling very well because I'm seeing a lot of results and I'm constantly learning a lot. I think that is another great quality for a leader to have to always be open to being wrong and always be open to learning more and listening to direction, taking mentorship, leadership and valuing furthering your education and any way that you possibly can. So I love to educate myself, I love to learn from others and I think that is a key quality that a leader should have that as well as being fair and balanced in managing approaches, being good at monitoring all things and also actually having the skills to maintain um what's the word, I'm looking for consistency, to maintain consistency",POSITIVE,0.899,0.0045,0.0886,0.0079,732.0,MED,7,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),12.59,0,0,1,"Bachelor's degree (e.g. BA, BS)",Other,9.008526,8.730081,8.550194

I have frequently worked in some of our busiest periods and I have always maintained a level of calm that has ensured a clear and controlled running of our venues and kitchens in particular, serving Up to 200 tickets on a Tuesday in our kitchen, but also working sold out club venue nights without needing additional support from other areas of the venue. I put this down to my focus when working from my ability to ensure that both myself and the team around me remain focused and calm. I ensure this through positivity by ensuring that my management style or my supervision style, I should say, is not needlessly aggressive, anything that needs resolving in more serious way. He's done very calmly and to the side, there is never any raised voices and because that is not helpful for anyone in these positions, this comes to the fact that I try to be very personable in my working relationships. I believe that a healthy working environment in both busy times and quieter times is what is most useful to ensure a functional workplace and a workplace that can adapt to new stressful situations. I I believe that as a manager, I can bring that adaptability, particularly looking at the variety of work experiences I have having worked not only in kitchens, but as bartenders as creative producers, as scare actors in across a variety of venues across the country. this point and this adaptability means that nothing that approaches me as a manager would be surprising and anything that is, I have a wide network of people with experience to call on, I think it is important that managers aren't afraid to ask for that kind of help when they need it, because it shows to their team that their team is able to come to them to request that kind of help should it be required. I think that as a leader, I'll be able to show a team, a leader that is happy to assist and guides them willing to give a helping hand, someone who is not aggressive with them. I have experienced aggressive managers in the past and I have seen firsthand how damaging that can be for a team's morale and how damaging that can be for service. And ultimately, the reason we are in this industry is to provide high quality service and that is something that I would like to continue to do this venue. I believe I have done this so far and I'm sure the rest of the team that I work with and supervise and I that I am supervised by will be able to a test for this, we do work very closely, there are very few of us who work together at the same time and whenever we do, I feel, but I have gotten along with them well that we have worked together well to maintain a controlled and openly supportive working environment.

If someone doesn't understand what you're asking of them then they're not going to do it and or they will do it, but it won't be exactly what was needed in order to achieve the end result.

And leading a group of people because sometimes they don't mash well you might have differing personalities or different um work ethics, but at the at the end of the situation, what you want is something that is cohesive and useful. And for me particularly um I'd like to think that I listened very well. I like to think um that I will go out of my way to make sure that other people feel comfortable and what I am asking is within their competency and is within their um not necessarily within their comfort zone because sometimes it is good to stretch yourself a little bit, but it is important to recognize where you are at with your own style of communication and how other people accepted. So if someone says, hey you your approach with this made me uncomfortable, then I have to internalize that and find a way to navigate a way that makes it more comfortable for how I'm interacting in the future. Otherwise I'm not a good leader. Um you have to take criticism and and being able to give criticism as well is a very, very important skill because it always has to be constructive, there's no point in tearing someone down because then your relationship will deteriorate and you yourself, there will be tension and an ongoing relationship won't necessarily be comfortable or possible, and that's not necessarily what you want from somebody in a leadership position.",POSITIVE,0.8638,0.0019,0.1287,0.0056,546.0,LOW,6,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),7.43,0,0,1,"Bachelor's degree (e.g. BA, BS)",Other,8.884293,9.202246,9.291622

So uh I think I'll start a little bit off with my history of leadership. I've been pursuing leadership roles since I can remember honestly I was always that sort of kid who would volunteer to help out the teachers, I was very active in volunteering, I would do a lot of uh you know park restoration projects around the area. I volunteered with my local church but also a few different groups in the area uh for young people to get involved in their communities. And so I've always been really passionate about being able to help other people and being able to get a group of people together to like really make a change and make a difference. So that really influenced every choice I made in life the summer camp that I went to growing up, I became a counselor there ah and I loved working there and my goal had always been to be a counselor there because I loved the experience that I wanted to be able to help lead and shape the Children who have gone to that camp for leadership development skills actually it was a leadership development program which is kind of funny, I didn't even realize that when it was bringing that up. Um and every place I go, even if I'm not in a specific leadership role, I do always find myself reaching out to other people on the team who I see possibly needing support in certain areas I feel more comfortable in or helping connect them to people that I know would be able to support them in those areas that they're struggling with. Um So that's kind of my at least history. Oh and also if you look on my resume there, you'll see that I was a resident advisor at the college that I went to. So that's just another example of the leadership roles that I've been seeking out my entire life when it comes to my style of leadership. I guess I'll be talking about how I support those that are in the you know the rules though, the people I'm supporting, I support those people, How many times can I say support Good Lord, and also how I'll be motivating them. So under support, I'm the sort of person who I will always be off to the size just waiting to help you out when you ask for it, I'm not the sort of person who just keeps badgering you if I see you as slowing down or anything like that because I know that sometimes people just want to be able to work through their own problems, but it's more empowering for people to be able to come to me to request the support rather than me taking that agency away from them and that choice from them. So I always make sure that they know that they can come to me with, really anything that they need. Oh, I apologize for this bouncing around, I have to get more comfortable position. So that's one way that I help support people is by mostly staying possibly at a further distance than other supervisors do in terms of overseeing the work. But I also build those connections with those people. So they do know that I am always around, I'm always talking with them just about life in general, because that's the only way to grow a team, right, is to get to know each other and to build those connections with each other as human beings because you can't, it's harder to work well with people when you don't really know them outside of that context, at least I found that. So that's another way that I help out my team that demonstrate leadership is by connecting in a very personal way with each person on the team. To help build that network of relationships and understanding of each other and then under uh motivating. That's another reason why it's so important to build those personal relationships with people. Because if you understand who that person is, then you understand what motivates them and how to work together as a cohesive unit",NEUTRAL,0.414,0.0221,0.5616,0.0023,745.0,HIGH,12,100.0,2.0,Using only (2),9.639999,0,0,1,"Bachelor's degree (e.g. BA, BS)",Other,9.639573,9.951184,9.918655
